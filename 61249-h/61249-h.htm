<h2 id="PREFATORY_NOTE">PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>


<p>Few who know the fine old quarto ‘<i>Dæmonologia Sacra</i>’ of Dr
Gilpin will dispute its right to a place of honour in the Series of later
Puritan Divines. To those who have not hitherto heard,&mdash;or only
heard of it,&mdash;we commend it with all confidence and urgency as in
various respects a remarkable book by a remarkable man. It will be
found&mdash;as an early writer says of another&mdash;‘<i>matter-full</i>,’ and nevertheless
suggestive rather than exhaustive&mdash;that is, you have many
rich lodes of the ore of thought opened, but many others indicated,
not worked; clear and keen of insight into the deepest places of the
deepest things discussed; wide in its out-look, yet concentrated in its
in-look; sagacious and wise in its general conclusions, and passionate
as compassionate in its warnings, remonstrances, and counsels; full of
faith in all ‘written’ in The Word, and pathetically credulous in
accepting testimony when a given fact (alleged) is fitted to barb
an appeal; curious and quaint in its lore; intense and anxious in its
trackings of sin without and within; pre-Raphaelite in the vivid
fidelity of its portrayals of satanic guiles, and guises that are always
disguises; and above all, tenderly <i>experimental</i> in its consolation to
the tried and troubled. The third part is an exposition of the Temptation
of our Lord, which may bear comparison for thoroughness and
power with any extant.</p>

<p>For our Memoir of Dr Gilpin we have had literally to do everything,
inasmuch as next to nothing has thus far been published concerning
him&mdash;not even his birthplace, or birth or death dates known.
If still we feel the result of our ‘labour of love’ in prosecuting the
necessary researches, to be very inadequate, it is gratifying that we
have secured so much as we have done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span></p>

<p>As in the preparation of former Memoirs, our visits and investigations
have brought us much pleasant intercourse and correspondence
with descendants, representatives, and reverers of the old Worthy.
Family papers of the most private nature have been unreservedly
confided to us&mdash;as duly acknowledged in each place where referred to
or used; and altogether the most ungrudging help has been rendered.
The various friends mentioned in the foot-notes of the Memoir will
be so good as accept this further general acknowledgment.</p>

<p>It only remains to state that the present volume has been edited
on the same principle with Sibbes and Brooks. The text is given
with scrupulous integrity; references and quotations are traced, and
less known names and dates annotated; every reference or quotation
of Scripture verified and filled in; and copious indices are subjoined;
the two last the more important, that Dr Gilpin himself seems to
have quoted Scripture from memory, and furnished no ‘table’ or
index beyond the heading of the several chapters as ‘contents.’</p>

<p>May this revised treatise be used at this later day as in the past, to
help in the great warfare against the Adversary.</p>

<p>⁂ It has not been deemed needful to give a list of such slight <i>errata</i> as have come
under our eye in preparing the indices; but mark, with reference to the ‘Note,’ page 2,
that for ‘Dr’ there is a misprint of ‘Mr,’ and that ‘deficiency’ is spelled with an ‘i’ for
an ‘e.’&mdash;G.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="MEMOIR_OF_THE_REV_RICHARD_GILPIN_MD">MEMOIR OF THE REV. RICHARD GILPIN, M.D.</h2>


<p>In pursuing our investigations for our Memoir of <span class="smcap">Richard Sibbes</span>, we
found and noted, that his name&mdash;in every one of its odd variations
of spelling, numerous as those of Shakespeare and Raleigh&mdash;had quite
died out at once of his native county and country, being traceable
nowhere for fully a century of years&mdash;the stream which rose at Cony-Weston,
Norfolk, in 1524, lapsing in a ‘Richard Sibbes, clerk, rector
of Gedding, aged 93, February 2, 1737;’ and the blood thenceforward
flowing in the female line.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Very different is it with the name of <span class="smcap">Gilpin</span>, now before us. From
family-muniments and genealogies intrusted to us by various representatives,
of nearer and remoter kin, it were easy to go back many
generations before the earliest-noticed <span class="smcap">Sibbes</span>; while at the present
day, in nearly all gradations of circumstance, at home and abroad&mdash;from
the original Cumberland and Westmoreland, to ‘the gray metropolis
of the North:’ from the Castle of Scaleby, to ‘huts, where
poor men lie;’ and from Wyoming of Pennsylvania to Acadie of
Evangeline and ‘distant Ind’—<span class="smcap">Gilpins</span>, descending from our Worthy,
and proud of the descent&mdash;sustain the ancient renown of goodness and
brain-power. As I sit down to put my collections into shape, I am
called to place therein the statesman-like Speech on a great public
question of our age, of <span class="smcap">Charles Gilpin</span>, in the House of Commons&mdash;words
destined to re-echo again and again, and determine legislation&mdash;so
grave, wise, patriotic, Christian are they; and now the Libraries
are being besieged for the ‘New America’ of William Hepworth
Dixon, wherein I was gladdened with a splendid, yet penetrative
and measured, eulogy of the Founder of Colorado, <span class="smcap">William Gilpin</span>;<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
both, as I am informed, as do nearly all of the name&mdash;in this re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>sembling
the Rogerses of the United States, who all claim descent
from John Rogers, proto-martyr of England&mdash;counting from Bernard
Gilpin, the apostle of the North, the venerable and holy St Bernard
of Protestantism; and so, as we shall see, from our Richard.</p>

<p>I place in an Appendix<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> such genealogical-antiquarian details as
some readers may look for in a Memoir of a Gilpin; and summarise
here that the author of ‘<i>Dæmonologia Sacra</i>’ was sprung of a race
such as old Dan Chaucer would have cited in teaching ‘<i>who is worthy
to be called gentill</i>’ as we may judge by a few of his golden lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">‘The first stocke was full of rightwisnes,</div>
   <div class="verse">Trewe of his worde, sober, pitous, and free.</div>
   <div class="verse">Clene of his goste; and loved besinesse,</div>
   <div class="verse">Against the vice of slouth, in honeste:</div>
   <div class="verse">And but his heire love vertue as did he,</div>
   <div class="verse">He is not gentill, though he rich seme,</div>
   <div class="verse">All weare he miter, crowne, or diademe.’<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Turning now to <span class="smcap">Dr Richard Gilpin</span>&mdash;whose remarkable book is in
the present volume faithfully reprinted; he was grandson of Richard,
a younger brother of the illustrious Bernard, his father being an Isaac
Gilpin. We get a glimpse of both grandfather and father in the
county History as follows:—‘In a small manuscript by one Isaac
Gilpin,&mdash;whose father [Richard Gilpin, <i>as before</i>] had been steward of
several manors within the barony of Kendal, and died about the year
1630, at the age of 92 years,&mdash;he says he had heard of his father, and
observed the same himself, that by general custom within the said
barony, if a woman hath an estate, and married, hereby the estate is
so far vested in the husband, that he may sell it in his life-time; but
if in his life-time he doth not alter the property, then it shall continue
to her and her heirs.’<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> This little record takes us to ‘the barony of
Kendal,’ the ‘Land’ of Bernard Gilpin; and thither accordingly, we
turned our search. There was a vague traditionary understanding
that our Richard Gilpin was born, as of the same family, so in the
same region of ‘Kentmere;’ but nothing definite had hitherto been
known. The Kentmere ‘Registers’ do not commence until <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
1700; and thus we were baffled there. But Kentmere being a
chapelry in the old Parish of Kendal, a hope was indulged that in
the parent-parish the wished-for facts should be discovered; nor were
we disappointed, for in the Baptism-Register, under date ‘October
23, 1625,’ there is this entry:—</p>

<p>
‘Richard, son of Isaac Gilpin, of Strickland Kettle,’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span></p>

<p>which is our Worthy, as after-dates will shew.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> He might be born a
week more or less previously, according to the then ‘use and wont’
of infant baptism. The same Register furnishes another earlier entry,
which&mdash;if we are correct in surmising that the Isaac Gilpin of Strickland
Kettle in 1625, was the same with the Isaac of it&mdash;informs us
Richard was a younger son:—</p>

<p>
‘1623, May 3, Henry, y<sup>e</sup> soun of Mr Isaacke Gilpin of Helsington.’</p>

<p>Elsewhere he is named ‘of Gilthroton, co. Westmoreland;’ and seems
to have been the same who was clerk to the Standing Committee of
county Durham in 1645.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> That Isaac Gilpin was ‘steward of <i>several</i>
manors’ probably covers the different local designations. There are
so many Gilpins, and so many of the same Christian name, that it is
hard to decide on given personalities; but, after considerable comparison
and sifting, such appears to us to be the parentage paternally
of Dr Gilpin. Maternally I have come on nothing; for an Elizabeth
Gilpin, widow of Isaac Gilpin, merchant, Newcastle, though of the
same stock, was not his mother. This ‘widow’ was buried in All
Saints, 7th November, 1694.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Archdeacon Cooper, of Kendal, in
transmitting these data, remarks: ‘The mode of writing, and the
insertion of <i>Mr</i>, indicates a person of some importance.’ But with
reference to ‘Mr,’ I suspect it is rather accidental, as it is inserted in
the one, and left out in the other; and moreover, is frequently
omitted when, from other sources, we know the family was of importance.
Little Richard must have been just beginning to toddle
about when his venerable grandfather’s snow-white head [‘aged 92’]
was laid in the old Church-yard. One delights to picture the aged
Simeon, before his serene departure, ‘blessing’ by prayer his dear
little grandchild, after the manner of such ancient Puritans as were
the Gilpins in every branch.</p>

<p>Strickland-Ketel, not Kettle, as in the Register and vulgarly,<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>&mdash;now
settled to have been the birth-place of Dr Gilpin,&mdash;was a most fitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
nest for one destined to serve the master-Shepherd so well. It is an
English Bethlehem&mdash;a rich, kine-fragrant, pleasant, breezy tract of
pasture-land, sloping from the west down to the river Kent, its eastern
boundary, which river, issuing out of a fair ‘mere,’ or lake, gives its
name to Kent<i>mere</i> Hall, the seat of the elder house of the Gilpins.
The hamlet of Ketel itself is on the road from Kendal to the Ferry
on Windermere; and thus partakes of the glory of Wordsworth’s
poetry, as of Scott’s, who in Rokeby celebrates a local incident of the
Cromwellian time.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> It is somewhat noticeable that within the space
of an ordinarily-sized farm should have been born <span class="smcap">Bernard Gilpin</span>
and <span class="smcap">Henry Airay</span>,<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and later, Richard Gilpin.</p>

<p>Of the childhood of our Richard, we can tell nothing directly. But
with the famous ‘School’ founded by his honoured ancestor available,
we are safe in assuming that he entered it. It is of this School that the
later biographer of Bernard Gilpin,&mdash;himself a Gilpin,&mdash;thus writes:
‘The effects of his endowment were very quickly seen. His school was
no sooner opened than it began to flourish, and to afford the agreeable
prospect of a succeeding generation rising above the ignorance and
errors of their forefathers.’ ... ‘That such might be its effects,
no care on his part was wanting. He not only placed able masters
in his school, whom he procured from Oxford, but he likewise constantly
inspected it himself.’<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The saintly Apostle was long gone to his
rest before the advent of Master Richard; but as bearing the name,
and being of the blood of the Founder, he could not fail to be welcomed
to all its privileges. The more’s the pity that no memorial seems to
have been kept of the scholars of this celebrated Institution. Before
proceeding to Houghton, he was probably initiated into learning at the
nearer Kendal, then all astir with the enterprise of the Flemings. So
I gather from family communications made to me; and thus we have
to think of the ‘little lad’ trotting down the quiet rural roads among
the sunny hills, much as another Richard earlier, from Packenham to
Thurston,<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent12">... ‘with his satchel</div>
   <div class="verse">And shining morning face,’</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span></p>
<p><i>not</i>, we may be sure,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent12">... ‘creeping like snail</div>
   <div class="verse">Unwillingly to school.’<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is a tradition,&mdash;reported by various descendants,&mdash;that our
Gilpin went from ‘School’ to Queen’s College, Oxford. This, it will
be remembered, was Bernard Gilpin’s own College, and whither he sent
his favourite scholars, as Airay, Carleton, Ironside, and others. So
that if Richard went to Oxford at all, Queen’s would most naturally
be selected. No mention of him, however, occurs in any of the College
Registers. Therefore he cannot at any rate have graduated.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> I place
in Appendix incidental valuable <i>data</i> concerning other related Gilpins
gleaned in Oxford.<a id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>In lack of the facts of the case, it is impossible to explain why one
so well-born and well-introduced did not, apparently, follow out a full
University career. That the circumstances of his own Family and
kindred were adequate thereto&mdash;apart from the Gilpin ‘endowments,’
which were open to him specially&mdash;and that they were of the right
stamp to appreciate a sound, liberal education, is certain from numerous
notices of the house that occur in old records.<a id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Another floating tradition,&mdash;also brought before me by descendants,
is, that our Gilpin studied at the University of Glasgow; which so far
receives confirmation from the statement of his bosom-friend Alderman
Barnes of Newcastle&mdash;of whose MS. ‘Memoirs’ I have already spoken&mdash;that
‘he was educated in Scotland;’ but neither there does his name
occur.<a id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>Equally uncertain is it,&mdash;advancing further,&mdash;when or by whom
Dr Gilpin was ‘licensed’ or ‘ordained’ as a Preacher of the Gospel or
Clergyman. Barnes again says that he ‘administered the Lord’s
Supper to a small congregation in Durham;’<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and Calamy, that ‘he
had been [<i>i.e.</i>, before Greystoke] a Preacher in Lambeth, at the Savoy&mdash;where
he was assistant to Dr Wilkins&mdash;and at Durham.’<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Of all of
these, the memorial has perished. Neither under ‘Lambeth,’ nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
‘Savoy’, nor ‘Wilkins’&mdash;afterwards Bishop of Chester<a id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>&mdash;nor ‘Gilpin,’
does Newcourt’s <i>Repertorium</i><a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> mention him; nor, after considerable
investigation in each place, has any trace of him been found beyond
the above statements. So that his presentation to the Living of Greystoke
in Cumberland is really the first definite fact we have, after his
now ascertained birth-place, baptism-date, and family connexion. The
Rector of Greystoke had been ‘sequestered’<a id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> by Sir Arthur Haselrigge
and the Parliamentary Commissioners for the Propagation of
the Gospel in the four northern counties; which sentence having been
appealed against, was confirmed by the Committee for (as they were
called) Plundered Ministers. The Rector was William Moreland,
M.A., ‘bred,’ according to Walker of the ‘Sufferings,’ folio, ‘at Jesus
College, Cambridge.’<a id="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> This ‘ejection’ took place in 1649-50. He
was succeeded by ‘one West, who died in about two years’ time.’<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
Such is all Walker says of West; but from another overlooked
authority, we learn a little more of him. In the ‘Postscript’ concerning
‘Mr John Noble,’ added to Audland’s funeral sermon on that
notable man, it is said, after mentioning the ‘laying aside’ of Mr
Moreland, ‘certain Commissioners appointed others, in his room, to
supply the Parish, when John Noble was little turned of twenty years
of age;’ and then, ‘In the year 1650, Mr West was sent, a zealous
Preacher, and one mighty in prayer, but sickly; and he soon died of
a consumption. His doctrine being exemplified in his own life, was
very effectual on many in that Parish, and particularly on John Noble,
who received lively convictions of Divine truth and the world to come,
and so began earnestly to inquire about the life and power of godliness.’<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
Gilpin immediately succeeded Mr West, and thus must have
entered on his duties in 1652 or 1653, when he was in his twenty-eighth
or twenty-ninth year.</p>

<p>What influence procured our Worthy the ‘presentation’ to this
(comparatively) rich benefice,&mdash;for it was then worth £300 per annum,
now nearly trebled, being from £700 to £800, we do not know; but
among the neighbouring gentry there were intermarriages with the
Gilpins, <i>e.g.</i>, the Laytons and Whartons&mdash;the former the ancient owners
of Dalemain in Dacre, the next parish to Greystoke. The Living was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
held by the family of Arundel&mdash;with a branch of whom it remains&mdash;but
was subject no doubt to the Commissioners of Parliament during
the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>We have Richard Gilpin, then in 1652-53 installed as the ‘parish
priest’ of Greystoke; and save him of Bemerton, none ever brought a
finer spirit, or a more entire consecration, or a more ‘ingenuous’
activity, to the service of the one great Master.</p>

<p>Visiting Greystoke recently, I found it a quaint-visaged, gray,
long, low-roofed church, venerable and time-stained still, though
‘restored’&mdash;tenderly&mdash;in 1848. It is dedicated to St Andrew. It
nestles in a ‘bit’ of woodland such as&mdash;flushed with autumnal tints of
green and gold equal to the glories of a New England Indian summer
among the maples and elms&mdash;would have burdened and kindled the
eyes of a Ruysdael or Gainsborough, aye and until the ‘studies’ were
transferred to imperishable canvas; and the whole surrounding district,
sweet, soft, and tranquil enough for the Valley of Rip Van Winkle’s
long dreamless sleep&mdash;much more so indeed than Irving’s own, behind
the shaggy bluffs of the Hudson. It is a genuinely English ‘parish.’
When Gilpin came to it, the ‘<i>common people</i>’ were intelligent and
godly after the antique type of the mid-Reformation period, having a
spice of sturdy originality of character and speech that is not altogether
gone even now. For ‘leisure hours,’ if the cultured Rector wished
it, there were in the country Seats&mdash;embracing ducal Castle and historic
family mansion&mdash;men and ‘faire ladyes’ of rare force and worth.
There are ‘Sunny Memories’ still&mdash;treasured in dim old manuscripts&mdash;of
the full ‘gatherings’ from far and near, from hall and hut, from
plain and fell, of the ‘gentle and simple’ over a wide area&mdash;to hang
on the lips of the ‘good Parson,’&mdash;as everywhere he came to be named.
We have a fine ‘testimony’ to the integrity and devotedness of the
Rector in the ‘Postscript’ of John Noble’s Funeral Sermon, previously
quoted: ‘Graistock parish was large, had a fair glebe and liberal
revenue. It had four chapels: the nearest three miles distant from
the Church. Mr Gilpin provided worthy, preaching ministers for
those, and allowed generously for their support; himself residing at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>
Graistock, where he had a society of communicants prepared by the
foregoing efficacy of the word on their minds and hearts, and manifested
in a new life,’ (page 41.)</p>

<p>Altogether Greystoke could not be other than a most congenial
portion of the great ‘Vineyard’ for one like <span class="smcap">Richard Gilpin</span>, who
breathed the very spirit of saintly <span class="smcap">George Herbert</span>, and had little
taste for the controversies in which some of his contemporaries were
engaged.</p>

<p>Not very long after his settlement at Greystoke, viz., in 1654-5, a
sad disaster befell the parent or ‘Kentmere’ house of the Gilpins,
springing out of the ‘confusions’ of the Commonwealth. I shall let
the good Prebendary tell it,&mdash;preliminary remarks and all, from the
manuscript already quoted,&mdash;reserving comment: ‘In the year 1655,
says he, ‘Cromwell dissolved his refractory parliament, and the members
of the House retiring to their several counties, spread everywhere
such new matter of discontent that measures were no longer observed.
Men were levied in many places against the usurper, and a general
rising was expected. But Cromwell, who had his eyes in all places,
soon dispersed every insurrection as it made its appearance. It was
at that time he sent his major-generals throughout the kingdom to
punish with fines and proscriptions all delinquents. Among the
families ruined by the severity of these military magistrates was Mr
Gilpin of Kentmere Hall, near Kendal, in Westmoreland. He was
the head of the family, and lived respectably on an estate which had
been in the hands of his ancestors from the days of King John. <i>It
seems probable he had taken an active part against Cromwell in the
kings life-time</i>; but his affairs being composed, <i>he lived quietly</i> till
these new disturbances broke out on Cromwell’s violent measures with
the parliament. <i>Having joined an unsuccessful insurrection</i>, he became
a marked man, and was obliged to provide for his safety as he
could. To avoid a sequestration he gave up his estate in a kind of
trust-mortgage to a friend, and went abroad. There he died; but in
a time of quiet, his heir not being able to get hold of the proper deeds
to recover the estate, it was totally lost to the family. <i>In the meantime</i>
Dr Gilpin <i>lived quietly at Greystoke</i>, concerning himself only with
his own parish, and lamenting those public evils, which he could not
remove.’<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> One can smile at this time of day at the name ‘Usurper’
applied to England’s mighty Protector; can understand the inevitable
royalism of a dignitary of the Church, that holds for ‘the king’ as
against ‘the kingdom,’ can leave the admissions of former freedom to
‘live quietly,’ and of an active part ‘against Cromwell,’ to justify any
enforced flight, without either refuting allegations or exposing prejudices.
But as matter of fact, while Dr Gilpin, in common with many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>
of his Presbyterian brethren, condemned the execution of Charles,
and while the shadow that fell on Kentmere doubtless darkened the
rectory of Greystoke, he yet unreservedly accepted the government of
Cromwell, and in every way sought to carry out the measures devised by
the Parliament. Moreover, far from ‘<i>living quietly at Greystoke</i>,’ and
‘<i>concerning himself only with his own parish</i>,’ it is the very opposite
of the facts. Instead of retiring in the timid, nerveless fashion suggested,
he took a foremost part in organising that modification of
Church government which the abolition of Episcopacy demanded.
The evidence of this, spite of the wreck and loss of contemporary
‘records,’ is abundant; and it is the next landmark in the Life we
are telling.</p>

<p>It needeth not that in a necessarily brief Memoir such as this we
should enter on the <i>merits</i> of the national change of Church ‘Polity’
which gave supremacy for the time to Presbytery over Prelacy. The
materials for judgment lie in fulness in every worthy Ecclesiastical
History of England; and the whole story has just been re-written with
fine candour and attractiveness by Mr Stoughton.<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Presbyterianism
in England during the Commonwealth can hold its own,&mdash;lustrous as
it is with the names of Edmund Calamy and Bates and Manton,
Richard Baxter and William Jenkyn and Thomas Watson, Samuel
Clark and Thomas Wilson of Maidstone, and Thomas Hall of King’s
Norton,&mdash;selecting a few, urban and rural, almost at random.</p>

<p>Suffice it to recall that, outside of the more ambitious organisation
of London,&mdash;whose unpublished ‘Memorial’ lies all but unknown in
Sion College Library,<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>&mdash;there were various voluntary Associations
which took a semi-Presbyterian mould, in the counties of Chester,
Cumberland, Westmoreland, Dorset, Wilts, Worcestershire, and
others. These Associations embraced the ‘clergymen,’ and ‘ministers’
or ‘pastors,’ and laymen belonging to the Episcopalians, the
Presbyterians, and the Independents, and sought to combine the presidency
of the first with the union and co-operation of the second, and
the freedom of the third; in short, a federated rather than organic
oneness. Subordinating everything else, was an intense yearning after
nearness to all who loved the one Lord Jesus, and heroic as devout
endeavours for ‘discipline,’ so as to vitalise and Christianise ‘the
<i>masses</i>.’ It is pathetic to read of the days and nights of these good
men’s Fasting and Prayer ‘unto the breaking of the light,’ for one
another’s Parishes and Charges. Their ideal was lofty, their own
practice beautiful, their success marked in changing the face of erewhile
godless and heathen-dark communities. What <span class="smcap">Richard Bax<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span>ter</span>
was in Worcestershire, <span class="smcap">Richard Gilpin</span> was in Cumberland and
Westmoreland; and as the author of ‘The Saint’s Everlasting Rest’
was chosen to draw up the ‘Agreement’ for his county, so the author
of ‘<i>Dæmonologia Sacra</i>’ was selected to execute the same office for
Cumberland and Westmoreland. The ‘Agreement,’&mdash;of which the
title-page will be found in the list at the close of our Memoir, must be
studied by all who would master the problems of the period. It is
comprehensive, without being general or vague; decisive in dogma,
but not uncharitable; high in aim, but most practical; earnest, but
not fanatic; stern to offences, but hopeful and tender toward offenders;
richly scriptural, but also, and because of it, most human, all a-glow
with wide sympathies, and unutterably wistful in its appeals for oblivion
on all lesser matters, so as to set a firm front to the evils and
passions, the divisions and heart-burnings, the rivalries and recriminations,
of the time. The whole is perfumed, so to speak, with prayer.
If it was a Utopia, it was a grander and more celestial one than ever
More or Bacon imagined; nor while it lasted was it a mere paper
Agreement. For years through all the Counties enumerated the
‘good men and true’ made their ‘gatherings’ so many centres of light
and love; and their Parishes were as spiritual Goshens amid the
national formalism and barrenness.</p>

<p>Seeing that the extent to which ‘<i>Dæmonologia Sacra</i>’ has gone
prevents our reprinting the minor writings of Gilpin, as we had
desired, we shall here give a few brief extracts from the ‘Agreement,’
to illustrate its aims, tone, and style. Thus he struck the key-note:
‘When we compare the present miseries and distempers with our former
confident expectations of unity and reformation, our hearts bleed
and melt within us. We are become a byword to our adversaries;
they clap their hands at us, saying, “Is this the city that men call the
perfection of beauty?” Piety is generally decayed, most men placing
their religion in “doting about questions” which they understand not;
profaneness thrives through want of discipline; error, blasphemy
domineers; jealousies, divisions, unmerciful revilings and censurings,
are fomented among brethren of the same household of faith; the
weak ones are discouraged and distracted by the multitude of opinions
and fierce opposition of each party, and that which is worst of all,
God’s honour suffers deeply, and the credit of religion is brought very
low. “Is this nothing to you, all ye that pass by?”’ But having
lamented, as with Jeremiah, he assumes a more hopeful and encouraging
attitude, thus: ‘Though these things can never be sufficiently
lamented, yet seeing it is not sufficient barely to lament them,
without endeavouring to heal them, and considering that it is a duty
incumbent upon all Christians, according to their several places and abilities,
to promote the welfare of Zion, especially when we have tasted so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span>
much of the bitterness of our divisions, and because a brotherly Union
hath so much of God in it, and consequently gives so much hope that
God will take that course in establishing his Church when he shall
arise to build Jerusalem, and seeing it is an unjustifiable pettishness
and peevishness of spirit to be averse from joining together in anything
because we cannot join in all things, therefore we resolve, [“the
associated ministers,”] setting aside all carnal interests, and casting
ourselves, with all our concernments, at the Lord’s feet, to walk together
as far as we can for the present, not resting here, nor tying
ourselves from further progress in union, as the Lord shall give light
and satisfaction, much less binding ourselves from a submission to
and compliance with a more general accommodation, if any such
thing should hereafter be agreed on, which might be more suitable
and fitted for the composure of the different principles of brethren
throughout the nation.’—(Pp. 1-3.) Hereupon follows the ‘Basis’ of
the ‘Agreement,’ which was very much the same with Baxter’s in
Worcestershire, and that of Essex, &amp;c., &amp;c. ‘In order,’ he proceeds,
‘to the carrying on of this great work, we lay down and assent
unto these general rules as the Basis and Foundation which must
support and bear up our following Agreement:—</p>

<p>‘1. That in the exercise of discipline it is not only the most safe
course, but also the most conducing to brotherly union and satisfaction,
that particular churches carry on as much of their work with
joint and mutual assistance as they can with conveniency and edification,
and as little as may be, in their actings, to stand, distinctly by
themselves and apart from each other.</p>

<p>‘2. That in matters of church discipline those things which belong
only <i>ad melius esse</i>, ought to be laid aside, both in respect of publication
and practice, rather than that the Church’s peace should be
hindered.</p>

<p>‘3. That where different principles lead to the same practice, we
may join together in that practice, reserving to each of us our own
principles.</p>

<p>‘4. That where we can neither agree in principle nor in practice, we
are to bear with one another’s differences that are of a less and disputable
nature, without making them a ground of division amongst
us. Yet notwithstanding we do not hereby bind up ourselves from
endeavouring to inform one another in those things wherein we differ,
so that it be done with a spirit of love and meekness, and with resolutions
to continue our brotherly amity and association, though in those
particulars our differences should remain uncomposed,’ (pp. 3, 4.)</p>

<p>Further, all pledge themselves to be true and faithful ambassadors,
stewards, workmen, and overseers, and ‘to this end we resolve in the
course of our ministry to observe the temper, disposition, and capacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span>
of the generality of the people, and to suit ourselves not only in our
matter to the people’s condition, but also in our expressions to the
people’s apprehension, that so our sermons may be plain, piercing,
seasonable, and profitable,’ (p. 4.) Speaking next of ‘catechising’
from the Assembly’s ‘Larger and Shorter’ Catechisms, and of ‘inspection,’
there are these wise counsels, that there be tender dealing in
consideration of ‘first, unacquaintedness with the terms and words of the
question; or, secondly, from bashfulness or shamefacedness,’ (p. 11.)
And in regard to ‘supervision,’ to be cautious ‘lest brotherly inspection
degenerate into an unbrotherly prying,’ (p. 15.) And there is
this pronouncement on a <i>questio vexata</i> of the period: ‘We agree not
to press a declaration of the time and manner of the work of grace
upon the people as a necessary proof of their actual present right to
the Lord’s Supper, nor to exclude persons merely for want of that; yet
will we accept it if any will be pleased to offer it freely,’ (p. 16); and
onwards there is encouraged a ‘holy modesty and bashfulness’ in
speaking of the ‘passage and transaction ‘twixt God and our soul,’
(p. 39.) Finally, the Confession of Faith consists of the Creed paraphrased,
and confirmed by texts, (pp. 23-25.)</p>

<p>Another incident proved with equal unmistakableness that <span class="smcap">Richard
Gilpin</span> regarded Oliver as no ‘usurper,’ but the rightful governor
of the nation. I must leave the reader to consult the authorities
on the history of the establishment of the University of Durham.
Every one who knows anything of ‘the times’ knows that the efforts
to found a University there&mdash;which the death of Cromwell delayed,
and the Restoration quashed&mdash;is one of the ‘boasts’ of the Protector’s
reign.<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> In honoured association with Sir Thomas Widdrington,
Lords Fairfax, Grey, Wharton, and Falconbridge, Sir Henry Vane,
and Sir Arthur Haselrigge, and other well-known names, Gilpin was
appointed one of the ‘Visitors.’<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> He had entered into the scheme
with enthusiasm and hope. It is difficult to estimate what was lost
herein by the death of Cromwell. If we may conjecture from the
‘Model’ of the learned and pious Matthew Pool&mdash;issued in 1657-58,
while the grand jury were addressing Richard to complete what his
father had begun&mdash;it is all but certain that a more strictly theological
training would have been inaugurated than any of the great Universities
even to this day supplies.<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>To shew that Dr Gilpin still adhered to his former action in Church
matters, it must here be stated that in 1658 he preached a ‘Sermon’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</span>
before the ‘associated ministers of Cumberland’ at Keswick. By the
request of the ‘General Meeting’ he published it. The title-page will
be found in our list of his writings at close of this Memoir. It was
with reluctance the good man consented to give his sermon ‘to print,’
as he intimated in the ‘Epistle Dedicatory.’ ‘What your commands,’
says he, ‘have wrested from me&mdash;for of that force and prevalency
with me are your desires&mdash;I now lay at your feet. If I could have
prevailed with you to have altered your vote, or after you had passed
it, durst have resisted&mdash;this had gone no further than your own hearing.
But when you would not be persuaded, I endeavoured to conform
myself to those Christians in Acts xxi. 14, and took up with
that which put a stop to their entreaties. “The will of the Lord be
done,”’ (pp. 1, 2.) The Text of this sermon&mdash;which is no common
one&mdash;is Zech. vi. 13, ‘Even He shall build the Temple of the Lord,’
&amp;c., and hence its title, ‘The Temple Rebuilt.’ I select a few of the
more easily detached sentences. First of all, concerning ‘Controversy,’
he says admirably: ‘Disputings, though they have their fruits,
yet are they like trees growing upon a rocky precipice, where the fruit
cannot be gathered by all, and not by any without difficulty and
hazard,’ (p. 3.) Again, on the office of the ministry, he exclaims:
‘Dream not of ease in an employment of this nature. God, angels,
and men have their eyes upon you to see how you will bestir yourselves:
it is your duty, and not a matter of unnecessary courtesy which
you may give or hold back at your pleasure. He that hath commanded
you ἐν τόυτοις εἰναι, (1 Tim. iv. 15,) to “give yourselves up
wholly to these things,” will not take himself to be beholden to you
when you have done your best: neither is it any disparagement to you
to become even servants to any: so that you may but gain them and
forward Christ’s work. They that think it below them to trouble
themselves so much with catechising, reproof, admonition, and are of
Ptolemæus his mind, who changed the title of Heraclides his book,
from πονου ἐγκωμιον to ὄνου ἐγκωμιον: as if laboriousness were nothing
but an ass-like dulness, making a man crouch under every burden;
but God having made the ox which treadeth out the corn to be the
hieroglyphic of your employment, he doth thereby teach you that
labour and patience are so far from being a disgrace to you, that they
are necessary qualifications for the calling of the ministry,’ (pp. 3, 4.)
Lastly&mdash;for we may not linger&mdash;take a burning and fearless reproof of
the lukewarm: ‘How cowardly and sinfully shamefaced,’ he observes,
kindling as he advances, ‘are many when they should plead for God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</span>
and truth, as if their own hearts did secretly question the reality of
religion! How strangely do many of the gentry spend their time!
What irreligious, prayerless families do some of them keep, when
they should shew better example to the meaner sort; and yet how
confidently can they censure others for hypocrites&mdash;sometime unjustly
concluding against the strictness of God’s ways from the liberty of
some professors&mdash;not considering what their own carriage and vanity
do testify against themselves! How do we needlessly multiply our
controversies and disputes! and with what bitterness do we manage
them, even when the strife is merely about words and method! and,
generally, how is the name of God and religion abused to serve the
designs of men! What strange religious people have we! Some
must needs be religious by taking up a singular conceit and opinion,
though a man may easily see their hearts through their lives: others
have all their religion on their tongue’s-end: they can have good discourses,
and yet be unconscionable in their callings, shops, and trading,’
(pp. 33, 34.)</p>

<p>Thus taking a conspicuous part in all that belonged to the interests
of the Church of Christ, our Worthy behind these went out and in
before his flock a ‘master-builder,’ from Sabbath to Sabbath preaching
the very gospel of Jesus Christ, with unequalled power, pungency, and
pathos combined, while he drew all hearts to himself; for he acted on
the maxim&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent12">‘All worldly joys go less</div>
   <div class="verse">To the one joy of doing kindnesses.’<a id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He was a large-hearted and open-handed man, as well as a faithful
‘preacher’&mdash;his life an exemplification of his teaching. He was, says
the ‘Noble’ memorial, ‘a gentleman and a Christian indeed; one of
singular gravity, temper, learning, and all valuable qualifications for
a minister; of a good family too, and an eligible estate; a witness and
an honour to the good cause of a further Reformation,’ (p. 38.) And
so he pursued the ‘even tenor of his way’ in his tranquil sphere. He
had married shortly after coming to Greystoke; but, curiously enough,
the lady’s name has not been preserved in any of the numerous family
papers put into my hands. The Greystoke ‘Registers’ record the
baptism of two of his children, William and Susannah. The ‘entries’
may be given here:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘1657. September. Borne the 5th Day in ye afternoune, and ye
23d day Baptized, William, the Soune of Mr Richard
Gilpin, p’son, [= parson], of Graistock.</p>

<p>‘1659. Susanna, ye Daughter of Mr Gilpin, p’son, of Graistocke,
was borne ye 17th day of October, And Baptized ye 7th
of December, 1659.’<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">xxix</span></p>

<p>I have described the parish of Greystoke as tranquil; but even into
it there swept&mdash;as the sea-swell sweeps into the smallest nook of shore&mdash;the
ruffle of that agitation which pervaded the nation in religious
matters; and, inasmuch as it gives colour and tone to not a few passages
of the ‘<i>Dæmonologia Sacra</i>,’&mdash;his difficulty with the Quakers&mdash;to
which I have made reference&mdash;falls now to be chronicled. We
shall have an after-occasion to notice subsequent interviews with the
pre-eminently good, though provoking, Quaker missionary-preacher,
Thomas Story. Here I glean my information from the ‘Memoir’
of a ‘Greystoke’ celebrity, <span class="smcap">Henry Winder</span>, D.D.<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The following,
then, is the narrative, omitting irrelevant portions:—</p>

<p>‘The Reverend Richard Gilpin, M.D., was the parish minister of Graystock
before the Restoration.... Some time before the Restoration
Quakerism began to spread in Cumberland and Westmoreland.
Among other things remarkable in their behaviour, the Quakers would
go into the parish church of Graystock, and disturb Dr Gilpin in the
pulpit during divine worship. And such were their novel phrases
and cross questions and answers, that the Doctor seemed sometimes at
a loss what to say to them. Upon that, some of his parishioners
were stumbled, withdrew from their former communion, and defended
the cause of the Quakers. Among others Henry Winder was seduced,
to the no small grief of good Dr Gilpin and his friends. A day
of humiliation and prayer was appointed, in which Dr Gilpin, and
some of the neighbouring ministers, as well as some of the laity of
that parish, took such proper methods as to recover some that had
fallen, and to confirm and establish those that were wavering, though,
before that, the infection had spread far and wide. Then was Henry
Winder secretly resolved to comply with the desire of Dr Gilpin and
his church, and make some public recantation. But these convictions
did not last long. For notwithstanding several conferences with him,
Henry Winder openly joined with the Quakers, and continued among
them some years.... Henry Winder and his [second] wife
[finally] left the Quakers, returning to Dr Gilpin’s church, in which
they afterwards continued.’<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>All this goes far to explain the unusual severity of the ‘<i>Dæmonologia
Sacra</i>’ against Quakers and Quakerism&mdash;as also the ‘Agreement’&mdash;and
the grave classification of ‘double meanings,’ and ‘light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">xxx</span>
within,’ &amp;c., &amp;c., among evident ‘devices’ of the Devil. At this later
day we willingly forget the eccentricities and vulgarities and blunders
of the early followers of <span class="smcap">George Fox</span>, and in the spirit of the
‘Quakers’ Meeting’ of winsome Elia, reverence the service of this
once powerful and still honoured and altogether inoffensive section of
God’s people.</p>

<p>With these minor ‘troubles’ now and again annoying him,&mdash;for
they ended in the setting up of Quaker ‘tabernacles’ in the district,
remains of which survive until now,&mdash;the Rector of Greystoke fulfilled
his ‘labour of love,’ as a good servant of Jesus Christ, until the
Restoration. That event found him with a mind made up and ‘ready’
for all loss and sacrifice. Unable to accept the notorious ‘Act’ of
Uniformity, he anticipated the memorable ‘Ejection’ of 1662 by
withdrawing from Greystoke; whereupon the former ‘sequestered
Rector Morland re-entered on possession.’</p>

<p>We turn to the Family-Manuscript,<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> formerly quoted, for the circumstances
of the resignation. ‘After the Restoration,’ observes Prebendary
Gilpin, ‘when Episcopacy again took the lead, the Presbyterian
party made what stand they were able. But the Act of Uniformity
passed, and was executed with rigour. Dr Gilpin, notwithstanding his
moderation, could not subscribe it in all its parts, and therefore
resigned his benefice, trusting God for the maintenance of himself and
family, which consisted of a wife and five children.’<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The good Rector was not without a home when he thus left his
beloved Greystoke&mdash;which was turned into a Bochim when his
‘parishioners’ looked their last upon him. During his incumbency
he had invested what ‘monies’ he had at his disposal in the purchase
from the Musgraves, of the Castle and small estate of Scaleby near
Carlisle&mdash;filling up the amount of the purchase-money by a mortgage.
Thither accordingly he retired into privacy; but holding with the old
Nonconformists the indefeasibility of his office as a preacher of the
gospel by an ordination more sure than that from quasi-apostolic
hands, he was wont to assemble his employés and neighbours in a
‘great room’ of the old Castle&mdash;originally a Border-fortalice erected
against the Scots&mdash;and there ‘preach’ to them on the Sabbaths.<a id="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</span>
Moreover, he resumed his previous medical studies and practice, to the
great advantage more especially of the poor. ‘How acceptable,’
says our Manuscript, ‘his services were among the poor people of those
parts, and how much they revered him for wisdom and sanctity,
appears from the superstitious respect they paid him. During many
years after his death, it was believed among them that he had “<i>laid
the devil</i>,” as they phrased it, in a morass not far from his house.’<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
Besides these semi-professional duties, he set about improving the
somewhat dilapidated castle, and the lands, more particularly planted
trees extensively; the result of which was an entire change of the
appearance of the estate, and now the fine woodland within which
venerable Scaleby lifts its gray towers, still worthily held by a descendant
through the female line.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Gilpin</span> was too eminent and potential a man to be allowed
to withdraw thus from the stage of public events. He had not been
long in his retreat when a ‘tempting’ offer was made him of a
Bishopric, as Bernard Gilpin had been ‘tempted’ before him. I
recur here again to our Manuscript. Following on the passage
already given we read, ‘The king and council however seemed to have
been apprehensive lest this rigorous step against the Presbyterians
[‘Act of Uniformity’] might have ill consequences. They were much
inclined therefore to compound the matter, at least, with some of the
leaders of the party; and, in this view, three or four bishoprics and
many superior dignities in the Church were offered to them. Among
others, Dr Gilpin was represented to the king as a person highly
esteemed in the Northern parts of England, and as a man of great
moderation. Accordingly, in filling up the vacant bishoprics, his
name was inserted for the see of Carlisle: and it was not doubted by
his friends but he would get over the few scruples he had to the Act of
Uniformity, and accept the preferment: for he had always spoken
favourably of the Church of England, and considered the line between
the two parties with regard to their religious sentiments as almost an
invisible one. But, to the surprise of his nearest friends, he declined
the offer.’<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> The ‘friends,’ who so lightly estimated the ‘scruples’ of
the ‘retired’ Rector, little knew the stamp of man he was. Everything
before and subsequent goes to shew that <span class="smcap">Dr Gilpin</span> remained a
Nonconformist, with, no doubt, the same reluctance as Baxter and
Calamy and the rest,&mdash;to whom bishoprics had similarly been offered,
and by whom they had similarly been promptly declined,&mdash;but also
from the same deep conviction of necessity so long as that ‘Act’ outraged
the truth, and ignored conscience. And so, as his ancestor,
Bernard Gilpin to Elizabeth,<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> did Richard Gilpin to Charles II.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</span>
refuse that mitre which he could not have worn unless at the sacrifice
of principles which were dearer to him then all civil or ecclesiastical
dignities, and life itself.<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> We have an incidental allusion&mdash;as I read
it&mdash;in ‘<i>Dæmonologia Sacra</i>’ to the ‘temptation,’ and the casuistic
pleas of the ‘friends’ alluded to. Speaking of the ‘wiles’ of the
Tempter, and his many snares to induce to sin, he specially notices
this, that ‘he extenuates the offence by propounding some smaller
good or convenience that may follow that evil,’ and he continues,
evidently speaking from his own experience of the ‘fiery dart:’ ‘This,
though it be a way of arguing directly contrary to that rule, “Do not
evil that good may come,” yet it oft proves too successful; and it is
like that common stratagem of war when, by the proposal of a small
booty in view, the enemies are drawn out of their hold into a fore-contrived
danger. Thus Satan pleads, This one act of sin may put
you into a capacity of honouring God the more. <i>Some have admitted
advancements and dignities against conscience, upon no better ground,
but they might keep out knaves, and that they might be in a condition
to be helpful to good men.</i> ... Thus a pretended good to come
becomes a pander to a present certain iniquity.’ There are other like
intimations in the book, which give new significance and a strange
passion to the words; but this one must suffice.</p>

<p>Recurring to our Family-Manuscript&mdash;which though somewhat
stilted in its style, is generally accurate in its facts&mdash;we reach the next
point in our Worthy’s ‘Life.’ ‘The Dissenters,’ remarks the Prebendary,
‘having now found they could get nothing from government
beyond a Toleration, began to separate everywhere into assemblies,
and choose pastors of their own;’ and so eyes and hearts turned toward
the Doctor, secluded at Scaleby. ‘Among other places,’ the Narrative
proceeds, ‘a large congregation united at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where
they built a handsome meeting-house, and sent an invitation to Dr Gilpin
to be their minister; and though he had now taken his measures, and
laid his plan for a life of quiet and repose, he accepted their invitation,
and as soon as he could settle his affairs at Scaleby, removed with his
family to Newcastle.’ ‘Here,’ continues the Manuscript, ‘a new
scene of life opened before him. Hitherto he had lived in a country
retirement, both at Greystock and at Scaleby, where party prevailed
little. But here he was in the midst of a large town, divided by
various opinions, where his candour and moderation had an ample
field for exercise. In fact, I have heard it said that his meeting-house
was a kind of centre of unity among them all. It was frequented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</span>
as much by Churchmen as Dissenters, and they all found here, what
was seldom found in the pulpits of those times, their common Christianity
preached, unsullied by the religious contests which everywhere
prevailed. His preaching was extremely pleasing and popular. His
subject-matter, his language, his voice, his manner, were all engaging,
and made such an impression on the people as was never
worn out, but with the lives of his contemporaries.’<a id="FNanchor_45_45" href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>Gilpin arrived in Newcastle, as the successor of the admirable
<span class="smcap">Samuel Hammond</span>, one of the ejected,<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and the spiritual father of
Oliver Heywood,&mdash;about 1668-69, that is, in the crisis of the ‘troubles’
to all who bore the ‘mark’ of Nonconformity. High-Churchmen
were ‘building-up,’ as they deemed it, the Church, by persecuting
relentlessly those who dared not acquiesce in the ‘Act of Uniformity;’
and accordingly ‘Dissenters’ had to preach furtively, even as ‘of old,’&mdash;and
all was clamour and confusion. One of themselves, who, if not of
kin, was, in wit and wiseness, of kind, in more than name to Thomas
Fuller,&mdash;thus vividly describes the period during which the recluse of
Scaleby went to his new charge in Newcastle: ‘I am ashamed,’ says
Ignatius Fuller, ‘that whilst the Jews’ temple was building, there
was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard in the house,&mdash;now
when we are raising an house to Him that dwells not in temples
made with hands, we should make so much use of iron and steel,
and should reckon guns and swords, flames and fagots amongst our
means of grace. I am sorry we should seem to have more of Nimrod
than Solomon in our building; that we should partake of the curse
poured upon the workmen at Babel&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Thus plunged into the midst of all manner of ‘oppositions’ and intolerance,
<span class="smcap">Richard Gilpin</span>, for a goodly number of years&mdash;as William
Durant before him&mdash;confined his ‘preaching’ to his own private house
in Newcastle. Very sad is it to come on ‘records’ such as these from
the ‘Depositions from the Castle of York, relating to offences committed
in the northern counties in the seventeenth century.’<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> They may be
well left to speak for themselves, without a word of comment:—</p>


<p class="hang">‘clxxvi. Richard Gilpin, Clerk, and others. For holding a <i>Conventicle</i>.</p>

<p>‘Aug. 4, 1669.&mdash;Before Ralph Jenison, Mayor of Newcastle,
Cuth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</span>bert Nicholson, cordyner, [= cordwainer,] saith, that upon Sunday last,
about five or six of the clock in the morneng, he did see a great nomber
of people goe inn to the house of Mr Richard Gilpyn, minister, in
the White Freers, and afterward, he went to parson Jo<sup>n.</sup> Shaw, and
acquainted him with the premisses. Whereupon the said Mr Shaw
togeither with the church-wardens, constables, and serjeants-at-mace,
by the comaund of Mr Maor, did repaire to the said Richard Gilpin’s
howse. And when they came there all the dores were shutt and made
fast. And after the dores were broken open, he did see these severall
persons come out, viz., Robert Johnson, merchant, Dr Tunstall, Wm.
Cutter, James Hargraves, merchant, Wm. Hutchinson, George
Headlyn, fitter, Charles Newton, gent, Humphrey Gill, gent, Jno.
Bittleston, tanner, Matthew Soulsbey, roper, Michaell Jobling, pully-maker,
Robert Finley, chapman, and diverse other persons to the
nomber of fortie.’</p>

<p>Again:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="hang">‘The information of Cuthbert Nicholas, cordwainer, against the
persons hereinafter named, for being att meetings and conventicles:&mdash;Mr
Richard Gilping, Mr William Deurant, Mr
John Pringle, Mr Henry Lever, preachers,’ &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>So early as 1663&mdash;which would intimate that Gilpin had previously
resided and ‘preached’ in Newcastle&mdash;Bishop Cosin wrote
to the Mayor of Newcastle, telling him to look sharply after ‘<i>the
caterpillars</i>,’ naming as the ringleaders, ‘William Durant, Henry
Leaver, <i>Richard Gilpin</i>, and John Pringle.’<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> When we consider who
these men were&mdash;every one a ‘pattern’ of godliness and consuming
consecration to the Master, and more especially that one of them,
viz., Gilpin, had lately refused to elevate himself to a level with Cosin,
it is hard to repress indignation; while the word of scorn, ‘<i>caterpillars</i>,’
reminds one of the Popish parallel of Pope Alexander, wondering
how the Signory of Florence could so far have forgotten what
was due to him and to themselves as to aid and abet that ‘contemptible
<i>reptile</i>,’ [vermicciattolo] in offending the majesty of the Holy See&mdash;the
‘reptile’ being <span class="smcap">Savonarola</span>; or the ‘<i>heretici et imperiti homines</i>’
of <span class="smcap">Salmeron</span>, as applied to Augustine and Chrysostom, Jerome, <i>et hoc
genus omne</i>.<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Very different was the ‘letter’ of Cosin, Bishop of
Durham to the Mayor, from that of another ‘in authority,’ who had
also addressed to his Worship of Newcastle ‘a letter,’ wherein he had
counselled amity and forbearance; so much so, that Mr Durant and
others of the preachers in Newcastle, returned him an answer of
thanks for his ‘inculcated exhortations to love the whole flock of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</span>
Christ, <i>though not walking in the same order of the gospel</i>.’ The
writer was <span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span>.<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Until the ‘Indulgence’ of 1672, Gilpin carried on his ‘ministry’
in the half-public, half-hidden, manner which these deplorable acts
indicate. At one time he had to leave his own house; for in the
Barnes’ ‘Memoirs,’ we read, ‘When the Five Mile Act came out, Dr
Gilpin lodged at Mr Barnes his house, for more security. When his
goods were destrained upon, Mr Barnes&mdash;to prevent their being
squandered away&mdash;replevyed them.’ ... ‘And when there was a
design to banish the Doctor from Newcastle, Mr Barnes, by persuading
the magistrates of his great usefulness in the town, by his skill in
physic, procured him quietness to the end of King Charles his reign.’<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
Not however until 1672 was there anything approaching ‘religious
liberty’ in England, and that only by connivance. Until that year,
practically, Nonconformity and Dissent from the Church of England
was politically treason, and ecclesiastically ‘illegal.’</p>

<p>The Reader will have noticed that by Barnes and others, our Worthy
is designated ‘Doctor,’ and that this stood him in stead on one
occasion. But the title was not due technically until 1676. In that
year he proceeded to Leyden&mdash;like Sir Thomas Browne earlier&mdash;and
there ‘took’ the ‘degree’ of M.D. By the kindness of Professor J.
Van Hoeden of Leyden, I am enabled&mdash;for the first time&mdash;to give the
‘record’ of it from the ‘Inscriptions of the Students.’<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> It is as follows:—‘Richard
Gilpin, [misspelled “Gulpin,”] Cumbridus,’ obtained
his degrees July 6, 1676&mdash;<i>post disputationem privatam de Historia
Hystericæ Passionis medicinæ doctor renunciatus est a clarissimo
Kraame</i>&mdash;and again, Richard Gilpin&mdash;<i>Med. Candid., anno 50, apud
Prof. Spinæus, die</i> xxix. <i>Junii 1676</i>. This second inscription is only a
week before ‘the promotion, <i>die</i> vi. <i>Julii 1676</i>.’ Gilpin ‘lodged’ with
Professor Spinæus during his brief visit. In the list at close of the
Memoir, along with his other Writings, is given the title-page of the
medical Dissertation or ‘Disputation,’ which he read on the occasion
and published. In passing, I may remark that the ‘Disputation’ is
entirely technical, so that there is nothing to interest an unscientific
reader.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</span></p>

<p>Returned from Holland as Dr <span class="smcap">Richard Gilpin</span>,&mdash;and by this time
married to his second wife, a daughter of a Cumberland squire, Brisco
or Briscoe of Crofton Hall,&mdash;he gave himself to his work with unflagging
zeal, with ever-deepening power and influence, and with most
gratifying tokens that he was not labouring in vain, nor spending his
strength for nought. He was now in ‘easy’ circumstances. ‘The
purchase,’ says Barnes, ‘of the Lordship of Scaleby had put him into
debt, but he now cleared it off,’ and Mr Barnes went with him to Sir
Richard Musgrave, and got the conveyances finished, and this because
‘by the encouragement his ministry met with from the liberality of
the people, and his emoluments by the practice of physic, he [had]
raised a considerable estate.’<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> He was vigilant as a ‘watchman’ on
the walls of Zion; and as he mellowed into a beautiful old age, surrounded
by a gifted and affectionate family, and having ‘troops of
friends,’ he came to be <i>the</i> representative man of Nonconformity, so
that the ‘care’ of all their churches, in large measure, came upon
him. Very pleasant must have been those holiday ‘escapes’ from
smoky Newcastle to the sylvan solitudes and brightness of Scaleby,
which he interposed between his toils.</p>

<p>His Congregation enormously increased&mdash;at a bound probably, for,
on the death of William Durant in 1681, his ‘flock’ was received by
Gilpin.<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Accordingly, in the course of years, he received several
‘helpers.’ One was the excellent William Pell, M.A., who, ‘ejected’
from Great Stainton in 1662, after being ‘seven years minister of a
congregation at Boston,’ removed to Newcastle, where, says Calamy,
‘he became assistant to Dr Gilpin, and died there, aged 63.’ This
was in 1698.<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Another was Timothy Manlove, M.D., who settled at
Pontefract in 1688, removed to Leeds in 1694, and became assistant
to Dr Gilpin in 1698. He died August 3, 1699, and Gilpin preached
two ‘Sermons’ before his funeral, informed by a fine spirit. They
were published; and the title-page will be found in our list of his
Writings at close.</p>

<p>As before with the ‘Temple Rebuilt,’ it was only by constraint
that Gilpin issued these Sermons&mdash;two in one. ‘The following Discourse,’
he says, ‘was preached without the least thought of offering
it to public view; and yet I was persuaded to yield to the publication
of it to prevent the printing of more imperfect notes.’ The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</span>
melancholy duty interrupted a series of Sermons on ‘Striving to enter
in at the strait gate,’ and from Galatians v. 16, ‘This I say then,
Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh;’ but,
he continues, ‘having received an intimation that my dear brother
and fellow-labourer, now deceased, had found such comfort in his
meditations of this scripture in his prospect of death, that he expressed
his desires that his funeral sermon might be upon this text,’ [Romans
viii. 35-39,] he had chosen it. I have space for only a very few sentences
from these ‘Sermons’ as follow:—“In all these things we are more than
conquerors.” It is a glorious victory to stand in an evil day when Satan
hath drawn up all his forces against us. It is a glorious victory not
only to escape without loss, but to gain by his opposition. Thus we
outshoot him in his own bow; and all this, <i>sine labore et sudore</i>,
easily through Divine assistance, (page 17.) Again: “We are led by
the Spirit” ver. 14. Whether we read the sense backward or forward
it holds true, “as many as are led by the Spirit are the sons of God,”
and “as many as are the sons of God have been and shall be led by
the Spirit,” (page 30.) He pays affectionate tribute to his departed
‘assistants.’ ‘It hath pleased God Almighty and the all-wise Disposer
of all things to make another breach upon us. It is not long
since he took Mr Pell from us, and now he hath called home Mr
Manlove, both of them excellent men, worthy ministers of the Gospel,
singularly both of them fitted with abilities for their work. They
were successively my dear brethren and fellow-labourers in this part
of God’s vineyard. It must be acknowledged that it is a stroke to be
lamented: and if we look upon the present Providence we may have
some cause to fear that when God is discharging His servants from
His work, and paying them their wages, that He may shortly break
up His house with us,’ (page 21.)</p>

<p>From what must have been a large correspondence, only two letters
of Dr <span class="smcap">Gilpin</span> have come down to us, in so far as known. The one is
an unimportant ‘note’ given in Horsley’s ‘Life of Dr Harle,’ (8vo,
1730,)&mdash;not worth reprinting; the other hitherto unpublished, and of
much interest and value, as shewing how staunch and true he was to
the last in his Nonconformity, and how his one fear in his ‘old age’
was lest the Church of England should absorb his large congregation
on his death.</p>

<p>This Letter is among the Ayscough MSS. 4275 in the British
Museum (Birchiana.) We have transcribed it <i>verbatim</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
‘<span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>, <i>Decemb. 13 ‘98</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Deare Sr</span>,&mdash;Since I writ last to you concerning ye proposed correspondence,
I received a lr from you, wherein you give answer to yr two
obiections wch I had mentioned to you. Your lr I communicated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</span>
ye brethren; but then there arose new mutterings about ye designe of
yr late reflections on the circular lre, [and they] have taken hold of ye
same advantages against it: so yt at present little is to be expected of
any procedure in yt matter till men see what will become of ye publick
outcry against it.</p>

<p>‘It hath pleased God to take from me my deare assistant, Mr Pell,
by a feaver; we buryed him last weeke. It is a sad stroke upon us
all, but it falls at present most heavy upon me. Ever since his sickness,
it became necessary for me (such are our circumstances) to
preach twice every Lord’s day, and I must continue to do so at least
every other Lord’s day for some time, because there are a small party
(and but a very small one) who have formed a designe, and are now
encouraged upon this sad occasion to open it. This party were ye
few remainders of Mr Durant’s congregation, who have kept communion
wth ours in all ordinances, wthout making any exceptions,
about 15 years; but when old Mr Barnes (their politick engineer)
brought home his young son Thomas, from London, they presently
shewed their intentions to choose him for their pastor; but as introductory
to that they (in my absence) thrust him into ye pulpit,
without so much as asking leave. I was silent, and suffered him to
preach in ye evenings; but they being weary of that&mdash;few people staying
to heare him&mdash;they thought it more conduceable to their designe
to separate from us, and set up at ye Anabaptists’ meeting-house; but
no great party would follow them, and now they have chosen him to
be their pastor, though before this he had in our pulpit vented some
unsound Crispian notions, and at last had ye confidence to contradict
what I had preached about preparation to conversion. For this, I
thought it necessary to give him a publick rebuke, and to answer his
exceptions. That theire designe is to worme us out of or meeting-house,
and to breake or congregation, is visible to all: they now
openly claime ye meeting-house for their pastor’s use, (when he
pleaseth,) and pretend old Mr Hutchinson (upon whose ground ye
house is built) promised them so much when they contributed towards
ye charge of building; but Mr Jonathan Hutchinson, his son, denyes
any such promise, and stands firmly to us, though Mr Barnes (his
father-in-law) surprised him wth solicitations; but we offer to repay
them all ye money they contributed towards ye building.</p>

<p>‘You see, Sr, how much I need your prayers, and (if it could be)
ye nomination of a man of parts, prudence, piety, and authority to
assist me at present, and to succeed me when I am gone. <i>Much of
ye dissenters’ interest in ye North depends upon ye welfare of or congregation.
The Episcopall party have long since made their prognostik,
yt token I die, ye congregation will be broken, and then there will be
an end of ye dissenters’ interest in Newcastle.</i> I pray give my deare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xl">xl</span>
love and respects to all ye brethren wth you, and pardon the trouble
given by, Revd. sr, your affectionate brother and servant,</p>

<span class="smcap">Rich. Gilpin</span>.’<br />
</p>

<p>On the 4th page, folio—For the Reverend Mr Richard Stratton, minister of ye gospel,

<p>We have little more to tell of the author of <i>Dæmonologia Sacra</i>.
He survived his estimable ‘assistant’ Manlove but a short time. But
to the last he was ‘in harness.’ Looking over old Papers he came
upon a Sermon which he had preached so far back as ‘1660,’ at the
‘Assize’ in Carlisle, revised and published it; and it bears the same
date of ‘1700’ as his own death: so that, like Sibbes, he must have
had proof-sheets passing through his hands very near ‘the end.’ The
‘Epistle’ or ‘Preface’ prefixed is as terse and effective as ever; and
the ‘Sermon’ itself manly, outspoken, faithful, and truly characteristic
of the man. The title-page will be found in our list.<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> This ‘Sermon’
having been preached before Judge Twisselton and Serjeant Bernard
and the ‘gentry’ present at the Assize, is specially searching on ‘sins’
in ‘high places,’ for Gilpin acted on the sentiment of Edward Boteler,
who, in his own quaint way, says of Earl Mulgrave, ‘He knew what
great evils evil great ones are; that they have many followers, go they
whither they will, and seldom go to hell alone.’ [As after, p. 48.]
I detach a single ‘particular’ from this weighty Sermon:—‘If magistrates
advance not the throne of Christ, they commonly prove furious
against it, and plagues of God’s people. If this proceed from a careless
blockish temper, then judgment of itself will degenerate into gall,
and the “fruit of righteousness into hemlock.” Justice, like water,
purifies itself by motion, when it “runs down like a stream:” if it be
a standing water, it corrupts, and <i>corruptio optimorum pessima</i>. If
this neglect proceed from enmity to Christ, then, seeing they have the
greatest advantages in their hands to do evil, they may “establish
wickedness by a law:” they can “push with the horn, and tread down
the pasture with their feet.” [Ezek. xxxiv. 18.] “When the wicked
beareth rule, the people mourn.” [Prov. xxix. 2.] Or if it proceed
from apostasy, then “the revolters are profound to make slaughter.”
[Hosea v. 27.] And this happens not so much from the churlish and
cruel dispositions of men, as from God’s giving them up judicially to
rage against His ways, either as a scourge to his people, or in order to
their own ruin. Hence it is noted that the cruellest persecutions were
set on foot by emperors, sometimes of the best parts, and most
civil dispositions, as Antoninus Philosophus, Trajan, Severus,
Decius, &amp;c. Magistrates are for the most part like the prophet’s figs,
either very good or very bad: they are the heads of the people, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">xli</span>
diseases in the head are dangerous; so when the leprosy appeared in the
head deeper than the skin, the party was pronounced utterly unclean,’
(pp. 13, 14.)</p>

<p>Calamy and Mr Thompson of Stockton thus record the ‘good man’s
end:’—‘He went,’ says the former, ‘into the pulpit the last time he was
in it under a feverish indisposition, and preached from 2 Cor. v. 2,
“For in this we groan, earnestly,” &amp;c.; and to the surprise of all, he
rather ‘groaned’ than spake this sermon. The lungs being at that
time too tender for work, his disease seized that part, and he was
brought home in a <i>peripneumonia</i>, which in ten days put a period to
his life.’<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> Mr Thompson, in his ‘Diary,’<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> thus writes:—‘Dr Gilpin,
y<sup>t</sup> eminent servant of God, died much lamented by all, on (Tuesday)
Feb. 13, 1699/1700, about eight o’clock in y<sup>e</sup> morning.’<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> He was interred
in the churchyard of All Saints, Newcastle. And the following is
the ‘entry’ in its Register of Burials:—‘1699 [= 1699-1700] Feb. 16.
Rich. Gilpin, doctor of physick.’<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> The ‘scutcheon of the ‘Kentmere’
Gilpins was placed on his coffin. He left a widow, who retired, as
her husband had asked, with her family, to Scaleby Castle.</p>

<p>From point to point of our Memoir, it has been our endeavour to
bring out the character of Dr Gilpin under his varying circumstances;
so that, unless I have failed more than I can suppose, my Readers must
by this time—even out of the scanty material which has been left to us—have
formed an idea of him, such as will bear me out, I anticipate, in
characterising him summarily as a man of no ordinary type, large of
soul,—with the spaciousness of genius that has been hallowed,—strong
and inevitable in his convictions, quick and sensitive in conscience,
intense and full of <i>momentum</i> in whatever he undertook; and, as his
‘<i>Dæmonologia Sacra</i>’ proves, profound, sagacious, keen in his scrutiny
of human and celestial-demoniac problems, and one who must have
carried sunshine with him wherever he went. His portrait—preserved
in Nova Scotia by a descendant, Dr Gilpin of Halifax—as engraved
in the earlier edition of Palmer, shews the liquid eye of genius,
the mobile lip, the brow compact and packed of brain, a nose somewhat
audacious, and a touch of sauciness in the chin, while the long
cavalier-like curled ‘locks’ of his wig seem to proclaim the lord of the
manor of Scaleby as much as the Preacher; for as Edward Boteler puts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">xlii</span>
it of another, with Fullerian alliteration, ‘Though he was very humble,
yet he knew how to be a man and no worm, as well as when to be “a
worm and no man.” He knew when to lay his honour in the dust,
and when to let no dust be upon his honour.’<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>I would now bring together several ‘estimates’ of our Worthy by
those who knew him well, and thus could form an accurate judgment
concerning him. First of all, I am fortunate enough to be able to
give, from an old, worn, and weather-stained holograph preserved by
Prebendary Gilpin, a quaint ‘Poem,’ which probably represents in
portions of it the inscription placed on his ‘monument’—long since
mouldered away. Here it is, rude and halting in rhyme and rhythm,
but biographically interesting:—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>I have next to set forth the famous ‘story’ of <span class="smcap">Thomas Story</span> the
Quaker missionary-preacher—of his interviews with Dr Gilpin;
wherein it will be seen he shews the deepest respect for him, albeit in
his self-opinionativeness unconvinced of the erroneous tendency of his
‘views’ and practice. These ‘notes’ are found in a folio that has
now gone out of sight, and become among the rarest of rare Quaker
books.<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> The narrative is too tedious for reproduction in full; but a
specimen will interest. Having told of his conversion to the prin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliv">xliv</span>ciples
of Quakerism, and more especially of the result of the reading
of ‘three small books,’ he goes on: ‘Some time after this, [1691,] Dr
Gilpin, before mentioned, sent his son, a counsellor-[at-law], under
whom I had been initiated into the study of the law, and who was
one of those at the tavern aforesaid, and still retained a great affection
for me—to invite me to his house at Scaleby Castle, and desired to
see some of the Quakers’ books, supposing I had been imposed upon
by reading them; and I sent him, as I remember, all that I had.
Soon after I had parted with these books, I observed a cloud come
over my mind and an unusual concern; and therein the two sacraments—commonly
so termed—came afresh into my remembrance,
and divers scriptures and arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>: and then I was
apprehensive the Doctor was preparing something of that sort to
discourse me upon; and I began to search out some scriptures in
defence of my own sentiments on those subjects: but as I proceeded
a little in that work I became more uneasy and clouded: upon which
I laid aside the Scripture and sat still, looking towards the Lord for
counsel. For I considered the Doctor as a man of great learning,
religious in his way, an ancient preacher and writer too, famous in
Oliver’s time, and a “throne” among his brethren: and that he might
advance such subtilties as I could not readily confute nor would concede
to, as knowing them erroneous, though I might not be suddenly
furnished with arguments to demonstrate their fallacy; and so might
receive hurt. And then it was clear in my understanding that
as he was in his own will and strength, though with a good intent, in
his own sense, searching the letter [of the Scripture,] and depending
upon that and his own wisdom, acquirements, and subtilty, leaning to
his own spirit and understanding, I must decline that way and trust
in the Spirit of Christ, the divine Author of the Holy Scriptures. And
as this caution was presented in the life and virtue of truth, I rested
satisfied therein, and searched no further on that occasion. When I
went to his house, he entered into a discourse on those subjects; and
had such passages of Scripture folded down as he purposed to use.
And when I observed it, I was confirmed that my sight of him in my
own chamber at Carlisle, and of his work some days before, was right,
[as if, to intercalate a remark, it needed prescience to foretell that the
Doctor’s appeal would be ‘to the Law and to the Testimony’!!] and
my mind was strengthened thereby. But before he began to move
upon the subject, he dismissed every other person out of the room, so
that himself and I remained alone. The first thing he said was, in a
calm manner, to admonish me to be very cautious how I espoused the
errors of the Quakers; for he had heard of late and with concern that
I had been among them, or seemed to incline that way. I answered
that I had not been much among them, nor seen any of their books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlv">xlv</span>
but those I had sent him, and knew not of any errors they held.
Yes, said he, they deny the ordinances of Christ, the two sacraments—Baptism
and the Lord s Supper; and then opened his book [his!]
at one of his down-folded leaves, where he read thus, 1 Cor. i. 2,
xi. 23, 26....’ Now follows the usual delusive appeals beyond
the ‘letter,’ as ‘carnal,’ and all the unconsciously-blaspheming, ‘<i>setting-aside</i>,’
of plain words that reveal ‘the mind of the Spirit,’ commingled
with a simple-minded self-superiority which need not be
illustrated. Very patient and wonderingly-silent must have been the
Doctor with his undoubtedly pious and acute, but most perverse,
visitor. He thus closes, ‘The Doctor did not oppose this, [about
prayer,] but only said I had given him better satisfaction on that
point than he had found in the book; and afterwards he was much
more free and familiar with me than before, or than I expected: and
so we parted in friendship, and I returned in peace and gladness,’<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
(pp. 41-45.)</p>

<p>But by far the most important, as it is the most elaborate, ‘estimate’
of our Worthy, is that of Calamy, who, usually marked by
judicial calm, and chary of praise, glows and burns in the fulness of
his admiration. The fervour of his eulogy of Gilpin contrasts with
his usual matter-of-fact statements, and surprises by its suddenness
and passion. With this I shall close those personal tributes by contemporaries.
Thus the ‘Account’ under ‘Grastoke’ runs:—</p>

<p>‘Richard Gilpin, M.D. He was designed by God for great work
in his church, and was singularly qualified for it. He had a large
share of natural abilities, which he had wonderfully improved by an
unwearied industry and long and hard study, so that there was scarce
anything that accomplished a man, a scholar, a physician, or divine,
but he possessed it in great perfection.</p>

<p>‘His stature was of the middle sort, rather inclining to the lesser
size; but his presence was far from being mean. There was a
pleasing mixture of majesty and sweetness, affableness and gravity in
his aspect. He could readily set his countenance to a severity or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</span>
mildness as the business or persons he had to do with required; and
he did it not by any artificial affectation, but naturally and with ease,
in such a way as kept up the dignity of his profession, and to such an
end as made religion both more awful and more alluring.</p>

<p>‘He had a delicate, fine, and polite fancy, expressing itself in a
plenty of words, which gave clear and lively images of things, and
kept up the life, strength, and elegancy of the English tongue.</p>

<p>‘His memory was strong and faithful, and gave back with great
exactness what he committed to it, though it was a treasury of
very great reading, and filled with variety of matter in several
sciences.</p>

<p>‘To these was added a most penetrating, discerning judgment.
This enabled him in reading to choose well, and to form a just
opinion of the sentiments of others, which was always with that candour
as made another considerable addition to his many excellences.</p>

<p>‘He had so well digested all necessary parts of learning that he had
them in readiness when he needed them. He used such things in
their proper place, and adorned his discourses with them as there was
occasion; and was able to make that which was little else but
pageantry appear with a due gracefulness and beautiful in its season.</p>

<p>‘As he had a rich fund of sense, learning, experience, and reading
to fit him for a divine, so he had all the qualifications necessary for a
preacher in the highest degree that can well be thought attainable.
The several endowments that make a man a true, divine, orator did
jointly meet in him.</p>

<p>‘He had a voice strong enough to command the most usual public
places of divine worship. It was piercing and sweet, and naturally
well modelled. He had the true skill of fixing an accent upon particular
words where the matter needed it. There was a force attended
his way of speaking without an undue transport. He was vigorous
and vehement, but under great conduct. His expressions were conceived
and his sermons delivered without the use of notes: and he
was qualified for that way of preaching. His pregnant memory, his
ready invention, his great presence of mind, his natural fluency, that
made him able to speak well and gracefully, with ease and assurance,
entitled him to it. He could clothe any matter in apt words, with all the
ornaments of a regular elocution. He fell neither into too swift an
utterance, nor was forced upon any unbecoming, unguarded expressions.
There was no restraint upon his delivery by being thus
managed. It made him only capable of speaking what he did with
much greater warmth and life and decency of gesture. It had all the
smoothness of style and propriety of words to make it acceptable. It
had all the graces of natural oratory, all the decencies of behaviour to
recommend it. And that which completed all, it came from a serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvii">xlvii</span>
mind, the concern of which was visibly to be read both in his countenance
and expressions. He spoke from his very heart, as appeared
sometimes in the force of his words, sometimes in his tears, and
usually in both. He spake with solemnity and seriousness, with
gravity and majesty, and yet with so much meekness mixed with all, as
declared him to be a man of God and ambassador of Christ. There
was a lively air of delivery, a sacred vehemence of affection in what
he spake, that were very much his peculiar talent. He knew how to
temper his discourses with due motion. His gestures were admirably
taking and graceful, and further expressive of what he was delivering.
In prayer he was likewise most solemn and fervent, and usually
expressed himself much in Scripture language, and with a flood of
affection. The very fountains of it seemed in the performance of that
duty to be broken up and the great deep of it opened. It often forced
him to silence for a little till it had flowed out at his eyes. In his
pulpit discourses he was a very great example, both as to the design
and method of them. His design was vast and noble in the ordinary
course of his preachings. He usually proposed some subject, and
pursued it on various texts. Every head with its enlargements was
closely studied, and his particulars under each general were admirably
chosen. If he had ever so many, none could be wanting; if never
so few, there seemed to need no more. In the handling of any subject,
after he had explained and proved what he had undertaken, with
a great deal of clearness and affection, he was most plain, familiar, and
moving in his applications. His way in these was another particular
talent that he had. In all his uses he was excellent, but mostly so
in his exhortations. He made them as so many set discourses of persuasion.
They were delivered with most address and greatest warmth
and vigour. He entered upon them usually with some rousing, lively
preface to gain attention, and then offered his motives, which were
prosecuted with the most pungent expressions. Here his earnestness
increased, together with his voice, and the vehemency of it. He had
a feeling apprehension of the importance of what he was then urging
upon his hearers, and every word was big with concern of mind.
He affected an elaborate eloquence at no time, but least of all
then. In easy but moving expressions, and with a distinguishing
πάθος he would plead with sinners sometimes for a whole sermon
together, without flagging in his affections or suffering his attentive
hearers to do it in theirs. He was a man of a distinguishing knowledge
and experience in the mysteries of Christianity; and of a discerning
spirit in understanding a work of grace upon the hearts of
others. With a clear head and searching skill in divine things, he
had a sincere and warm heart. The fire of zeal and the light of
knowledge accompanied one another. He kept up a serious temper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlviii">xlviii</span>
at all times and in all places and company, without much discernible
alteration or abatement; but this did not in the least sour his disposition,
which was cheerful, though thinking and solid. His skill in
government appeared in the managing a numerous congregation of
very different opinions and tempers. His integrity, modesty, and
contempt of the world, in refusing the bishopric of Carlisle, as another
of the family (Mr Bernard Gilpin) had done before him, consonant to
their motto, <i>dictis factisque simplex</i>. The care of the churches lay
upon him. His unblamable character had obtained amongst all but
those whose ill-nature would suffer them to speak well of none who
differed from them. He was much respected by many for the good
he had done them as a physician. Among persons of rank and
quality in the parts where he lived, all necessary means were scarce
thought to have been used if he had not been consulted. He went
about doing good to the souls and bodies of men. This world was
not in his eye, none could charge him with anything like covetousness.’</p>

<p>Be it remembered that these are the ‘words’ in every case, of men
who knew not to flatter, and spake out of ‘perfect knowledge.’
Above all, be it specially remembered that I have been quoting from
no ‘Funeral Sermon,’ with its almost inevitable exaggerations.</p>

<p>It only remains that I give a complete annotated list of the extant

King James I., he entitled “Dæmonologia Sacra,” the
largest and completest of any extant upon that subject.

his posterity think it convenient, (pp. 145, 146.) 2. John

<p>I have now to notice the <span class="smcap">Manuscripts</span> of Gilpin. By the courtesy
of the Rev. Bernard Gilpin, Bengeo, Hertford, I have had confided to
me the original holograph of ‘<i>Dæmonologia Sacra</i>,’ and in our reprint
I have found it clearing up occasional misprints and mis-pointings.
The MS. is not complete; the collation is as follows: General
title and three special titles, pp. 3. To the Reader, pp. 6, signed
‘Rich. Gilpin.’ Treatise on to Part II., page 255, (in our edition,)
ending in line 21st from top, 4 disqui[eting].’ The penmanship is
clear and legible, with few erasures, and having a margin on either
side. On the top of the page whereon Part I. begins, there is
the date, ‘Newcastle, July 9, 1671.’<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> Further: Calamy, in his ‘Account,’
thus mentions a <i>manuscript</i> treatise of which he had heard:
‘Among other things he hath left behind him in manuscript, a valuable
Treatise concerning The Pleasantness of the Ways of Religion;
and in whatsoever hands it lies, it is pity but it should see the light,’
(vol. ii. p. 157.) It is to be lamented that this appeal was not responded
to, as Prebendary Gilpin records sorrowfully its loss as follows:
‘Among his other papers was found a treatise of considerable
length, prepared, as it seemed, for the press, “On the Pleasures of
Religion.” This MS., and several other MSS. of Dr Gilpin’s, consisting
chiefly of heads and divisions of sermons, from which he used commonly
to preach, fell into the hands of the author of this memoir; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_li">li</span>
being deposited in a box with other papers, and placed in the corner
of a closet, were attacked by what is commonly called dry damp, and
were almost entirely spoiled. If anything had been interposed between
the bottom of the box and the floor so as to have suffered the air to
circulate, the mischief had been prevented;’ and what levity in the
custodier of so precious a legacy that this little care was neglected.
Mr Gilpin of Juniper Green writes me concerning these spoiled MSS.:
‘Nevertheless [<i>i.e.</i>, notwithstanding their utter destruction by the
dry-rot] my mother kept the fragments all the days of her life with
great veneration. But now these relics—they were little better than
ashes—of our ancestor have perished.’</p>

<p>I have thus done my best to revivify the story of <span class="smcap">Richard Gilpin</span>,
His highest ‘record’ is ‘on high;’ but those who love the memory of
our Worthy, will, it is hoped, accept kindly our endeavours to keep
his grave green, and to import, so to speak, personality to the name
in an old title-page—of one who did valiant service for The Master:</p>

<h3>APPENDIX TO MEMOIR.</h3>

<p>A.—Page xvi.—<span class="smcap">Ancestry and Descendants of the Gilpins.</span></p>

<p>The different ‘County’ Historians, and Works on the old families
of England, give more or less full details concerning the Gilpins in all
their many branches. The ‘Arms’ are <i>Or</i>, a boar passant sable,
armed and tusked Gules. A fine book-plate of this adorns Prebendary
Gilpin’s Family Manuscript. These ‘Arms’ are hereditarily understood
to have been derived from the fact that a Richard de Gylpyn or
Gilpin—who is regarded as the founder of the house—killed a wild
boar which had infested the neighbourhood of Kentmere, in the reign
of King John. [See Nicholson and Burns’ ‘Antiquities of Westmoreland
and Cumberland,’ (as before,) vol. i. pp. 135-137.] This
is confirmed by Sir Daniel Fleming’s Collection of Pedigrees, in the
possession of Sir W. Fleming of Rydal, Co. Westm. Bart. <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1713;
and is given by Bishop Carleton in his Life of Bernard Gilpin. From
these authorities, and various other Family documents, I construct
this genealogy of the elder House:—</p>

<p>1. Richard ... founder. He a son, 2. William, who married a
daughter of Thomas Ayray, bailiff of Kentmere. He a son, 3. Richard,
who married daughter of Fleming of Coningston, from whom many
descendants are found in and around Kendal. He a son, 4. William.
He a son, 5. Richard. He a son, 6. William, a captain at Bosworth
field, and there killed. He a brother, 7. Edwin, two of whose sons
were distinguished—viz., (1.) The ambassador of Queen Elizabeth to
the States of Holland. (2.) Bernard, the ‘Apostle of the North,’ was
the fourth son. He, [<i>i.e.</i>, Edwin,] a son, 8. William. He a son, 9.
George. He a son, 10. William. He a son, 11. George. He succeeded
by, 12. Christopher Gilpin, a half brother of George, in whom
the direct <i>male</i> line ended. The ‘Kentmere’ estate sold to Sir Charles
Philipson.—[<i>N.</i> and <i>B.</i>—<i>as before</i>.]—William, son of Richard, [= the
4th of our list,] married a daughter of Thomas Lancaster of Sockbred,
who descended of the baron of Kendal. His son Richard, again
[= 5th in our list,] married a daughter of Sir Rowland Thornborroux,
knight of Rampsell. This Richard married as his second wife Margaret
Layton = Enwine, second daughter of Thomas Layton of Dalemaine,
who had several sons—Anthony, Thomas, Sir William, Sir Bryan,
Sir Cuthbert, Sir Richard, all famous men, mostly soldiers, and some
knights of Rhodes. His daughters also intermarried with Redman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_liii">liii</span>
Carelton, Clyborne, and Vaux. We may now tabulate the descent.

<p>[See Hutchinson’s ‘History of Durham,’ vol. ii. 703, account of the
Gilpins, from a paper in the hands of Mr Rob. Sober of Sherburn,

time of making out Sober’s pedigree, is said to be living, and owner
of the ancient house of the Gilpins, Kentmere Hall.]</p>

<p>Turning to <i>Dr Richard Gilpin</i>, I have had two elaborate pedigrees
(of descent) entrusted to me, by the former of which, it appears our
Worthy had a very large family by, (as I understand,) his two wives.
By this also I find that his second wife was born ‘Oct. 15th, 1625,’
eldest daughter of William Brisco of Crofton—her name Susannah.
I have a suspicion that the first Mrs Gilpin died at Greystoke, and that
the Doctor re-married before leaving it; but owing to the time-worn
state of the Greystoke ‘Registers,’ all the entries that remain concerning
Dr Gilpin’s family are the two children given in our Memoir.
Following William and Susannah were, 1. Isaac, born July 12, 1658;
married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Clagget. Then, 2. Susanna,
born Nov. 27th, 1659; married Matthew Parlis, minister. [The
former Susannah must have died as a child.] Then, 3. Anne, who
married Sawrey of Broughton Tower, Esq. [On this marriage, see
Barnes’ ‘Memoir,’ as before, pp. 142, 143.] She was born December
5th, 1660. Then, 4. Elizabeth, born Aug. 3, 1662; died unmarried.
Then, 5. Richard: died of a blow of his schoolmaster. Then, 6.
Mary, born Dec. 28th, 1666; died unmarried. Then, 7. Dorothy,
born Aug. 13, 1668; married, (1.) Jabez Cay, M.D.; (2.) Eli Fenton.
Then, 8. John, born Feb. 13, 1669. [More of him immediately.]
Then, 9. Francis, born July 27, 1671; ob. infant. Then, 10. Bernard,
born Oct. 6, 1672, died in his youth at Jamaica, unmarried. Then, 11.
Francis, born Jan. 27, 1675, died in infancy. Then, 12. Thomas,
born July 27, 1677, died unmarried, June 20, 1700. Returning upon
John, [eighth of this list,] he married Hannah, daughter of Robert
Cay, Esq. of Newcastle, and left large issue, as follows: 1. Richard,
born April 9, 1700, (soon after his grandfather died,) died unmarried,
1723. 2. Robert, born 17th Aug. 1702, married Ruth, daughter of
Reynold Hall of Newbiggen, Esq. [More of this pair immediately.]
3. William, born Jan. 1, 1700 (?), married Mary, daughter of Thomas
Dickenson, clerk. 4. John, born 1st Sept. 1705. 5. Thomas, born
Jan. 8, 1711, ob. 12 March 1713. 6. Susanna. 7. A daughter. 8.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_liv">liv</span>
Barbara, born 16th May 1710, wife of Braithwaite of Stockton. 9.
Susanna, born 28th April 1712, wife of Isaac Cookson of Newcastle.
10. Hannah, born 22d May 1715, wife of.... Goldsmith. Returning
again upon Robert, [second of the list from John,] he had
issue—1. John, who married daughter of John Cookson of London.
He took the name of Sawrey on succeeding to the Broughton Tower
estate. 2. Richard, died in East Indies. 3. Ruth. 4. 5.
Jer. (?). William, [third of list from John,] had issue—1. Thomas,
ob. an infant. 2. John, dead 1809. 3. Robert, <i>ib.</i> 4. Hannah,
married. 5. William, died 18th September æt. 67. So much for
the first paper. Now for the second, which gives the descendants of
the eldest son of Dr Gilpin, viz., William, born, as stated in Memoir,
at Greystoke, 5th Sept. 1657. He became a barrister-at-law, justice of
the peace, and deputy vice-admiral for county Cumberland, and recorder
of the city of Carlisle; bought Highfield Moor and the tithes of
Crosby; died at Scaleby Castle, Aug. 14, 1724, æt. 67. He married
Mary, eldest daughter and one of the co-heiresses of Henry Fletcher
of Talantyre. The issue were—1. Susan Maria, born at Scaleby
Castle, 10th Nov. 1689, wife of Joshua Dacre Appleby of Kirklevington,
by whom she had issue—[will be enumerated immediately]. 2.
Anne, born April 14, 1691. 3. Richard, born 6th Feb. 1692, married
Mary, daughter of Enoch Hudson. 4. Dorothy, ob. an infant. 5.
Henry, <i>ibid.</i> 6. William, born at Whitehaven, married Margaret,
daughter of G. Langstaff. 7. Henry, born Oct. 1692, ob. at Jamaica.
8. John Bernard, born at Scaleby, Jan. 24, 1701, ob. circa 1776,
buried at Carlisle Cathedral. He married Matilda, eldest daughter
of George Langstaff, ob. circa 1773, buried at Carlisle. 9. Dorothy,
born at Scaleby, wife of Eaglivfield Griffith, born 4th Nov. 1703.
10. George, born at Scaleby, 29th Aug. 1706, married Elizabeth, third
daughter of George Langstaff. Returning on Susan Maria, [eldest
daughter,] she had a daughter, Elizabeth, born at Whitehaven, Feb.
12, 1708, ob. an infant, and a son, William, born June 1724, ob. at
Whitehaven, 4th Dec. 1779. He married Elizabeth Hodgson, daughter
of Robert Hodgson of Whitehaven, died at Denbigh Castle, 25th
April 1792, æt. 60. They had issue—1. William Gilpin, born at
Whitehaven, 12th Nov. 1758, ob. 15th Oct. 1822, at East Sheen, Surrey,
having married Sarah, daughter of George Holland, Esq. of London,
in 1793. Finally returning on John Bernard, [eighth, <i>supra</i>,] he was
father of the Rev. William Gilpin, vicar of Boldre, prebendary of
Salisbury, died April 5, 1804 at Boldre, æt 80. He will not soon be
forgotten, as his delightful books, with their carefully finished ‘Illustrations’
on ‘Picturesque Beauty,’ are gathering increasing value as
they become older. He had issue by his first cousin. John Bernard
Gilpin, Esq., who went to Philadelphia, and afterwards became British
Consul at Rhode Island. His descendants are now partly in Nova
Scotia, [J. Bernard Gilpin, Esq., M.D., Halifax,] and in England and
Scotland; and Rev. William Gilpin, born April 8, 1757, rector—an
excellent and venerable man, and clergyman—in county Salop; and
Sawrey Gilpin, born Oct. 30, 1733, ob. 1808. For the two Papers
whence most of the preceding details have been collected, I owe
thanks to my friend Joshua Wilson, Esq., Nevil Park, Tunbridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lv">lv</span>
Wells. I may add that in Prebendary Gilpin’s Family-Manuscript
there are ‘Memoirs’ of William Gilpin, Esq., the recorder of Carlisle,
containing valuable and interesting letters to and from the Lowther
family. The ‘Recorder’ was a man of mark. His portrait is at
Scaleby Castle. Next, severally William ‘merchant at Whitehaven,’
[See Story, as before.] Henry, of ‘the Navy,’ Thomas, John Bernard,
Anne, Dorothy, Susannah Maria, the eldest daughter, who must have
been a lady of uncommon originality and force of character, and
largeness of heart. [As <i>above</i>. She was married to Dacre Appleby,
Esq. of Kirklinton, contiguous to Scaleby Castle. Curiously enough,
their eldest son married a daughter of the Bishop of Carlisle. Mrs
Appleby ‘was followed by all the country, in tears, to her grave.’]
John Bernard,—a very capital ‘Memoir’ of a gallant soldier. Somerville,
in ‘The Chase,’ refers to the Windsor ‘roads’ constructed under
his military supervision. He was a familiar friend of the good Colonel
Gardiner. There are glimpses of the Rebellion of 1745 in this Memoir,
throwing light on events at Carlisle. At ‘leisure hours’ he
cultivated painting, and when he lived at Carlisle, he had sometimes
half a dozen young people, or more, who used occasionally to attend
him for instruction.’ Of these some became famous, <i>e.g.</i>, John Smith,
whom Lord Warwick sent to Rome, Robert Smirke, Esq., R.A., Mrs
Head, &amp;c. The Prebendary, in his MS., here gives also an account
of literary society of the period, including Warburton, Dr Brown, and
others. There are Letters of this many-gifted man, revealing a very
beautiful and tender veneration for his departed wife, whose loss he
‘mourned unto the grave.’ The correspondence between Mr and Mrs
Bernard Gilpin is striking and brilliant. Sawrey Gilpin, R.A., of
Knightsbridge, their son, became celebrated as an animal painter.
Sir J. D. A. Gilpin, another son, was knighted for his long services
in America, West Indies, and Gibraltar. He was a friend of Washington’s.
Catherine, sister of the two last, born at Scaleby Castle,
1738, was a woman of rare intellect, and a friend of Miss Blamire,
the sweet Poetess of Cumberland. In a new edition of Miss Blamire’s
‘Poems and Songs,’ recently published, there are given some by Miss
Gilpin, equal to the others. She died at Carlisle in 1811. Even these
bare names and dates will suffice to reveal a Family distinguished in
well-nigh every department of human achievement, to be placed in
their hereditary talent with the Hunters, Gregorys, and Browns, and
equally remarkable in their hereditary piety and worth, as well where
they belonged to the Church of England as where they held true to
Nonconformity, and their descent from the great and good Dr

<h2 id="TO_THE_READER">TO THE READER.</h2>
<hr class="small" />

<p>The accurate searches into the secrets of nature which this age hath
produced, though they are in themselves sufficient evidences of a commendable
industry, yet, seeing they fall so exceedingly short of that
discovery which men aim at—giving us at best but probable conjectures
and uncertain guesses—they are become as little satisfactory to
men that look after the true causes of things, as those ‘ships of desire’
whose great undertaking for gold had raised high expectations in their
attempts, but in the return brought nothing home for their ventures
but ‘apes and peacocks,’ [1 Kings x. 22, and 2 Chron. ix. 21.]
While men reflect upon themselves under such disappointments,
they cannot but check themselves, for over-promising themselves
in their adventures, with that of Zophar, ‘Vain man would be wise,’
[Job xi. 12.]</p>

<p>But how happy would it be for men if such failures of expectation
might better inform them! If our attainments in these pursuits will
not bear our charges, nor recompense our pains and loss of time with
an answerable profit, though we may see cause sometimes, as a divertisement
or recreation, to use them, yet how shall we satisfy ourselves
to make them our chief and sole business?</p>

<p>If we knew of nothing of higher concern to us than these, our neglect
of greater matters were more excusable; but seeing we are sufficiently
instructed that we have more weighty things to look after, such as
relate to a certain future estate of happiness or misery, the very discovery
of this to a rational being must needs entitle such things to the
first and greatest part of his care. He that knows that there is ‘one
thing necessary,’ and yet suffers himself to be diverted from the pursuit
of that, by ‘troubling himself about many things,’ [Luke x. 41,]
is more justly chargeable with folly, than he that neglects his estate,
and finds himself no other employment but to pursue feathers in the
wind.</p>

<p>Among those things that religion offers to our study, God and our
own hearts are the chief. God is the first and last and whole of our
happiness; the beginning, progress, and completement of it is from
him and in him—for in that centre do all the lines meet; but our
heart is the stage upon which this felicity, as to the application of it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
is transacted: upon this little spot of earth doth God and Satan draw
up their several armies; here doth each of them shew their power and
wisdom; this is treated by both; each of them challenge an interest
in it; it is attacked on the one side and defended on the other. So that
here are skirmishes, battles, and stratagems managed. That man,
then, that will not concern himself in his inquiries, how the matter
goes in his own heart, what ground is got or lost, what forts are taken
or defended, what mines are sprung, what ambuscados laid, or how
the battle proceeds, must needs lie under a just imputation of the
greatest folly; neither can he be excused in his neglect by the most
pressing solicitations of other things that seem to require his attendance
upon the highest imaginable pretences of necessity: ‘For what
is he profited, that gains the whole world, if he loses his soul?’ [Mark
viii. 36.]</p>

<p>But the exact and faithful management of such spiritual inquiries,
with their necessary improvement to diligent watchfulness and careful
endeavours of resistance, is another manner of work than most men
dream of. To discover the intrigues of Satan’s policy, to espy his
haunts and lurking-places in our hearts, to note his subtle contrivances
in taking advantages against us, and to observe how the pulse of the
soul beats under his provocations and deceitful allurements, how far
we comply or dissent, requires so much attendance and laborious skilfulness,
that it cannot be expected that such men who design no more
than to be Christians at the easiest rate, and content themselves with
a formal superficiality of religion; or such who, having given up
themselves to the deceitful sweets of worldly carnal delights, are not
at leisure to engage themselves in so serious a work; or such whose
secret guilt of rebellious combination with the devil against God,
makes them fearful to consider fully the hazards of that wickedness,
which they had rather practise with forgetfulness, lest the review of
their ways and sight of their danger should awaken their consciences
to give them an unwelcome disquiet; it cannot, I say, be expected
that any of these sorts of men, whilst they are thus set, should give
themselves the trouble of so much pains and toil as this business doth
require.</p>

<p>Upon this consideration I might rationally fix my prognostic of the
entertainment of the following treatise. What acceptance soever it
may find with such as are cordially concerned for their souls and the
realities of religion—and of such I may say as the apostle Paul concerning
brotherly love, 1 Thes. iv. 9, as touching this matter, ‘They
need not that I write unto them, for they themselves are taught of
God’ to be suspicious of Satan’s devices; and by experience they find
his deceits so secret, and withal so dangerous, that any help for further
discovery and caution must needs be welcome to them; yet—to be sure
the prince of darkness, who is always jealous of the least attempts that
may be made against his empire, will arm his forementioned subjects
against it, and whomsoever else he can prevail upon, by the power of
prejudice, to reject it, as urging us to a study more severe or harsh
than is consistent either with the lower degrees of knowledge of many,
or with that ease which most men desire to indulge to themselves; or
as offering such things which they, to save themselves from further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
trouble, will be willing to call chimeras or idle speculations: and this
last I may rather expect, because in this latter age Satan hath advanced
so far in his general design against all Christianity, and for the introduction
of paganism and atheism, that none now can express a serious
conscientious care for holiness and the avoidance of sin, but upon pain of
the imputation of silliness or whining preciseness; and none can speak
or write of conversion, faith, or grace, but he shall be hazarded by the
scoffs of those that are unwilling to judge the private workings of the
heart to God-ward, or spiritual exercises of grace, to be any better than
conceited whims and unintelligible nonsense: but seeing such men
make bold to jeer, not only that language and those forms of speech
which the Holy Ghost thought fit to make use of in the Scriptures,
but also the very things of ‘Faith,’ ‘Grace,’ and ‘Spirit,’ which are
everywhere in the sacred oracles recommended to us with the most
weighty seriousness—which with them pass for no better than cheats
and fancies—we can easily sit under their contempt; and shall, as we
hope, be so far from being jeered out of our religion, that their scorns
shall have no more impression upon us than the ravings of a frenzical
person that knows not what he speaks.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these, who are no way considerable for weight,
there are, I hope, a great many who seriously employ themselves in
the inwards as well as the outwards of religion—and who will not
suffer themselves to be persuaded that the apostle obtruded an empty
notion upon believers, when he recommended that observable truth to
them, Rom. ii. 28, ‘He is not a Jew which is one outwardly,’ &amp;c.;
for their sakes have I undertaken this labour of collecting and methodising
the grand stratagems and chief ways of delusion of the great
deceiver. To these I must particularly account for some few things
relating to this discourse. As,</p>

<p>1. That I have satisfied myself in the reasons of the publication of
these papers, and do not judge it requisite to trouble any so far as to
tell what these reasons are. They who desire to resist such an enemy,
and whose experience doth convince them that all helps are necessary,
will not need them; and those that are men of scorn or of avowed carelessness
will not regard them, though I should declare them.</p>

<p>2. To prevent the misapprehensions, which possibly some may
otherwise labour withal, of a monstrous product from one text,
because they may observe one text in the front, and no other
mentioned throughout the first and second parts; they may know
that I made use of several in the preaching of these discourses, as
suitable foundations for the several particulars herein mentioned;
but in the moulding up of the whole into the method of a treatise,
for the ease of the reader, I thought fit to lay aside those introductions—as
also many other occasional applications which were
proper for sermons, and a great many things which were necessary
to be spoken for explication and illustration of these points
to a popular auditory—and have only presented the substance in
a more close connexion; because if there be any little obscurity
that may at first appear to any for want of variety of words,
the treatise being under their eye, will be at leisure to attend their
review in a second or third reading; which, however, I would recom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>mend
earnestly to those that in these concerns do really design to be
‘wise for themselves.’</p>

<p>3. Neither should it seem strange that I have frequently made use
of instances from history or other later relations. Whosoever shall
consider the nature of the matter treated on will not complain of this
as a needless trouble put upon them; yet withal I have been so careful
of doing any persons an unkindness, by making too bold with them,
that I mentioned no names but such as upon such occasions have been
made public by others before. The rest I have only mentioned in the
general, discovering their case where it was useful, but concealing the
persons.</p>

<p>4. It may perhaps seem a defect, that the several directions, remedies,
or counsels which are requisite to be observed in making
resistance against Satan are not added, except some few hints in the
latter end of the third part, and some other things in that part, in the
applications of the several doctrines therein, which I thought fit, upon
good grounds, to leave in the order of a preaching method; but such
may be pleased to consider that several have performed that part very
fully, to whose labours I had rather refer the reader than trouble him
with a repetition. It was only my design to endeavour a more full
discovery, though every way short of the thing itself, of Satan’s craft,
because the knowledge of this is so necessary, and withal others have
done it more sparingly. Such as it is, accept and improve for thy
spiritual advantage; for that was the end of this undertaking, by him
who desires that thy soul may prosper,</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The introduction to the text, from a consideration of the desperate ruin
of the souls of men.—The text opened, expressing Satan’s malice,
power, cruelty, and diligence.</i></p>


<p>The souls of men are ‘precious.’ The whole world cannot repair
their loss. Hence by God are all men in particular charged with care
and watchfulness about them. He hath also set up watchmen and
overseers, whose business it is to watch over souls, and in the most
strict and careful manner, as those that must ‘give an account,’ [Heb.
xiii. 17.]</p>

<p>What can more stir up men to the discharge of this duty than the
frequent alarms which we have of the assaults of such an adversary,
whose business it is to destroy the soul? ‘The Philistines are upon
thee, Samson!’ [Judges xvi. 9;] he fights continually, and useth all
the policy and skill he hath for the management of his strength.</p>

<p>Besides, it is a consideration very affecting, when we view the ‘desolations
that are made in the earth,’ [Ps. xlvi. 8,] what wounds, what
overthrows, what cruelties, slaveries, and captivities these conquered
vassals are put to. It was, as some think, an inexcusable cruelty in
David against the Ammonites, when he ‘put them under saws, and
harrows of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln,’ 2 Sam.
xii. 31; but this spiritual Pharaoh hath a more grievous ‘house of
bondage,’ and iron furnace. Neither is this miserable destruction
ended, but will keep pace with time, and shall not cease till Christ
shall at his appearance finally conquer him and tread him down. If
Xerxes wept to look upon his army through the prospective of devouring
time, which, upon an easy foresight, shewed him the death of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
so great a company of gallant men, we may well weep, as David at
Ziklag, till we can weep no more; or as Rachel for her children, ‘refusing
to be comforted,’ [Jer. xxxi. 15;] while we consider what a
great number of succeeding generations, ‘heaps upon heaps,’ [Judges
xv. 16,] will be drawn with him to a consuming Tophet. And could
we follow him thither, to hear the cries of his prisoners, the roarings of
his wounded, where they ‘curse the day’ that brought them forth, and
themselves for their folly and madness in hearkening to his delusions,
the dreadful outcries of eternity, and then their ‘rage against heaven’
in cursings and blasphemings, while they have no mitigations or ease,
nor the refreshment of ‘a drop of water to cool their tongues,’ [Luke
xvi. 24,] we would surely think we could never spend our time better
than in opposing such an enemy, and warning men to ‘flee from the
wrath to come,’ [Mat. iii. 7,] to take heed they come not into his snare.
With what earnestness would we endeavour to persuade men! What
diligence would we use to cast water upon these devouring flames, and
to pluck men as brands out of the fire! It is true, if Satan had dealt
plainly with men, and told them what wages they were to expect, and
set a visible mark upon his slaves, or had managed a visibly destructive
hostility, men have such natural principles of self-preservation,
and of hatred of what appears to be evil, that we might expect they
would have fled from him, and still have been upon their guard; but
he useth such artifices, such sleights and cozenage, that men are cast
into a sleep or a golden dream; while he binds them in chains of
darkness they see not their end, the snare, nor the pit; nay, he intoxicates
them with a love of their misery, and a delight in helping forward
their ruin, so that they are volunteers in his service, and possessed
with a madness and rage against all that will not be as willing
as themselves to go to hell; but especially if they put forth a compassionate
hand to help any out of that gulf of misery, they hate them,
they ‘gnash upon them with their teeth,’ and run upon them with
utmost violence, as if they had no enemies but these compassionate
Samaritans, [Luke x. 33.]</p>

<p>How great is this mystery of darkness! Who shall be able to open
the depths of it? Who shall declare it fully to the sons of men, to
bring these ‘hidden things to light’? Especially seeing these hellish
secrets which are yet undiscovered, are double to those that have been
observed, by any that have escaped from his power. He only whose
prerogative it is ‘to search the hearts of men’ [Rev. ii. 23] can know,
and make known, what is in the heart of Satan; he views all his
goings, even those paths which the ‘vulture’s eye hath not seen,’ [Job
xxviii. 7,] and can trace those footsteps of his, which leave no more
print or track behind them than ‘a ship in the sea, or a bird in the
air, or a serpent on a stone,’ [Prov. xxx. 19.]</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding, we may observe much of his policies; and
more would God discover if we did but humbly and faithfully improve
what we know already. It is my design to make some discovery of
those haunts I have observed, if by that means I may be useful to you,
to quicken and awaken you. And first I shall set before you the
strength and power of your enemy, before I open his cunning and
craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>There are found in him whatsoever may render an adversary
dreadful.</p>

<p>1. As, first, <i>Malice and enmity</i>: ὁ Αντίδικος is a law term, and
signifies an adversary ‘at law,’ one that is against our cause; and the
text, as some think, heightens this malice, (1.) By the article ὁ, which
denotes an arch enemy.<a id="FNanchor_75_75" href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> (2.) The name Διάβολος, which signifies a
slanderer or calumniator—for the word is twice in the New Testament
used for a slanderer—shewing his hatred to be so great that it will not
stick at lying and falsehood, either in accusing God to us or us to
God. Nay, it particularly hints that when he hath in malice tempted
a poor wretch to sin, he spares not to accuse him for it, and to load
him with all things that may aggravate his guilt or misery, accusing
him for more than he hath really done, and for a worse estate than he
is really in.<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>2. Secondly, <i>His power</i>. Under the metaphor of a ‘lion,’ a beast of
prey, whose innate property is to destroy, and is accordingly fitted
with strength, with tearing paws, and a devouring mouth; that as a
lion would rend a kid with ease and without resistance, so are men
swallowed up by him as with open mouth, so the word καταπιῄ signifies,
he can sup them up at a draught, à καταπίνω.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, <i>His cruelty</i>: a ‘roaring lion’ implying not only his innate
property to destroy, which must be a strange fierceness, but also that
this innate principle is heightened and whetted on, as hunger in a lion
sharpens and enrages that disposition till he get his prey, so that he
becomes raving and roaring, putting an awful majesty upon cruelty,
and frighting them out of endeavours or hopes of resistance, and increasing
their misery with affrightments and tremblings. Thus Satan
shews a fierce and truculent temper, whose power being put forth
from such an implacable malice, must needs become rage and fierceness.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, <i>His diligence</i>: which, together with his cruelty, are
consequences of his malice and power; he ‘goes about and seeks.’
He is restless in his pursuit, and diligent, as one that promiseth himself
a satisfaction or joyful contentment in his conquests.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of the malice of Satan in particular.—The grounds and causes of that
malice.—The greatness of it proved, and instances of that greatness
given.</i></p>


<p>I shall first give some account of his malice, by which it shall appear
we do not wrong the devil in calling him malicious, the truth of which
charge will evidence itself in the following particulars:—</p>

<p>1. First, <i>The devil, though a ‘spirit,’ yet is a proper subject of sin</i>.
We need no other evidence for this than what doth by daily experience
result from ourselves. We have sins which our spirits and hearts do
act, that relate not to the body, called ‘a filthiness of the spirit,’ in con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>tradistinction
to the ‘filthiness of the flesh,’ [2 Cor. vii. 1.] It is true,
it cannot be denied but that those iniquities which have a necessary
dependence upon the organs of the body, as drunkenness, fornication,
&amp;c., cannot properly, as to the formality of the act, be laid at Satan’s
door, though as a tempter and provoker of these men he may be called
the father of these sins; yet the fore-mentioned iniquities, which are
of a spiritual nature, are properly and formally committed by him, as
lying, pride, hatred, and malice. And this distinction Christ himself
doth hint: John viii. 44, ‘When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of
his own,’ where he asserts such spiritual sins to be properly and formally
acted by himself. The certainty of all appears in the epithets
given him—‘the wicked one,’ ‘the unclean spirit;’ as also those places
that speak his fall, ‘They kept not their first estate,’ Jude 6; ‘The
angels that sinned,’ 2 Peter ii. 4. If sins spiritual are in a true and
proper sense attributed to the devil, then also may malice be attributed
to him.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, <i>The wickedness of Satan is capable of increase, a magis
et minus</i>. Though he be a wicked spirit, and as to inclination full
of wickedness, though so strongly inclined that he cannot but sin, and
therefore as God is set forth to us as the fountain of holiness, so is Satan
called the author and father of sin, yet seeing we cannot ascribe an
infiniteness to him, we must admit that, as to acts of sin at least, he
may be more or less sinful, and that the wickedness of his heart may
be drawn more out by occasions, motives, and provocations; besides,
we are expressly taught thus much, Rev. xii. 12, ‘The devil is come
down, having great wrath, because his time is short.’ Where we note
(1.) That his wrath is called ‘great,’ implying greater than at other
times; (2.) That external motives and incentives, as the shortness of
his time, prevail with him to draw forth greater acts of fury.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, <i>Whatsoever occasions do draw out or kindle malice to
a rage, Satan hath met with them in an eminent degree, in his own
fall and man’s happiness</i>.<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> Nothing is more proper to beget malice
than hurts or punishments, degradations from happiness. Satan’s
curse, though just, fills him with rage and fretting against God, when
he considers that from the state and dignity of a blessed angel he is
cast down to darkness and to the basest condition imaginable. For
the part of his curse, which concerned Satan as well as the serpent,
‘Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shall be thy meat,’ implies a
state most base, as the use of the phrase proves: ‘They shall lick the
dust of thy feet,’ Isa. xlix. 23; ‘Thine enemies shall lick the dust,’
Ps. lxxii. 9; ‘They shall lick the dust as a serpent,’ Micah vii. 17.
Where the spirit is so wicked that it cannot accept the punishment
of its iniquity, all punishment is as a poison, and envenoms the heart
with a rage against the hand that afflicted it. Thus doth Satan’s fall
enrage him, and the more when he sees man enstated into a possibility
of enjoying what he hath lost. The envy and pride of his heart boils
up to a madness—for that is the only use that the wretchedly miserable
can make of the sight of that happiness which they enjoy not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
especially if, having once enjoyed it, they are now deprived. This begot
the rage and wrath in Cain against Abel, and afterward his murder.
The eye of the wicked is evil where God is good. Hence may it be
concluded that Satan, being a wicked spirit, and this wickedness being
capable of acting higher or lower according to occasions, and with a
suitableness thereto, cannot but shew an inconceivable malice against
us, our happiness and his misery being such proper occasions for the
wickedness of his heart to work upon.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, <i>This malice in Satan must be great</i>.</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>If we consider the greatness of his wickedness in so great
and total an apostasy</i>. He is so filled with iniquity, that we can
expect no small matters from him as to the workings of such cursed
principles; not only is he wicked, but the spirit and extract of
wickedness, as the phrase signifies, Eph. vi. 12, [πνευματικὰ τῆς
πονηρίας.]</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>The Scripture lays to his charge all degrees, acts, and
branches of malice</i>; as [1.] Anger, <i>in the impetuous haste and violence
of it</i>. Rev. xii. 12, ‘Great wrath,’ θυμός, there signifies <i>excandescentia</i>,
the inflammation of the heart and whole man, which is violent in
its motion, as when the blood with a violent stream rusheth through
the heart and sets all spirits on fire; and therefore this wrath is not
only called great, but is also signified to be so, in its threatening ‘a
woe to the inhabitants of the earth.’ [2.] <i>Indignation</i> is more than
anger, as having more of a fixed fury; and this is applied to him,
Eph. iv. 27, in that those that have this παροργισμὸς, are said ‘to
give place to the devil,’ which is true not only in point of temptation,
but also in respect of the resemblance they carry to the frame and
temper of Satan’s furious heart. [3.] <i>Hatred</i> is yet higher than
wrath or indignation, as having deeper roots, a more confirmed and
implacable resolution. Anger and indignation are but short furies,
<i>ira brevis furor</i>, which, like a land-flood, are soon down, though they
are apt to fill the banks on a sudden; but hatred is lasting, and this
is so properly the devil’s disposition, that Cain, in hating his brother,
is [in] 1 John iii. 12 said to be the proper offspring and lively picture of
that ‘wicked one,’ who is there so called rather than by the name of
the devil, because the apostle would also insinuate that hatred is the
masterpiece of Satan’s wickedness, and that which gives the fullest
character of him. [4.] All effects of his cruelty arise from this root;
this makes him accuse and calumniate, this puts him upon breathing
after those murders and destructions which damned spirits are now
groaning under.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>This malice is the result of that curse laid upon Satan</i>:
Gen. iii. 15, ‘I will put enmity betwixt thee and the woman, betwixt
her seed and thy seed.’ Which implies, [1.] A <i>great enmity</i>; and
some render it <i>inimicitias implacabiles</i>, implacable enmities. [2.] A
<i>lasting enmity</i>, such as should continue as long as the curse should
last. [3.] That this should be <i>his work and exorcise</i>, to prosecute and
be prosecuted with this enmity; so that it shews the devil’s whole mind
and desire is in this work, and that he is whetted on by the opposing
enmity which he meets withal. It is the work of his curse, of his
place, of his revenge, and that wherein all the delight he is capable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
is placed. In that part of the curse, ‘Dust shall be thy meat,’ it is
implied, if some interpret right,<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> that if Satan can be said to have any
delight or ease in his condition, it is in the eating of this dust, the
exercise of this enmity. No wonder, then, if Christ speak of his
desires and solicitations with God to have a liberty and commission for
this work: ‘Satan hath desired to have thee, that he may winnow
thee,’ [Luke xxii. 31.]</p>

<p>That this curse relates not only to the serpent, who was the instrument,
but also to Satan, who was the agent, is agreed by all almost.
That it was not the serpent alone, but the devil speaking by it, is
evinced from its speaking and reasoning. And that the curse reached
further than a natural enmity betwixt a serpent and a man, is as
evident, in that Christ is expressly held forth as giving the full accomplishment
of this curse against Satan: 1 John iii. 8, ‘The devil
sinneth from the beginning; for this purpose was the Son of God
manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil,’ which is a
clear exposition and paraphrasis of the ‘woman’s seed bruising the
serpent’s head.’</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>I shall add to this some few instances of Satan’s
malice, by which it will appear to be great</i>.</p>

<p>[1.] First, That malice must needs be great <i>which shews itself where
there is such a load of anguish and horror that lies upon him</i>. He is
now ‘reserved in chains of darkness in hell,’ 2 Peter ii. 4. He is in
hell, a place of torment; or, which is all one, hell is in him. He carries
it about him in his conscience, which, by God’s decree, binds him to
his horror like a chain. It is scarce imaginable that he should have
a thought free from the contemplation of his own misery, to spend in
a malicious pursuit of man. What can we think less of it than a
desperate madness and revenge against God, wherein he shews his rage
against heaven, and hunts after our blood as for a little water to cool
his tongue; and when he finds his hand too short to pull the Almighty
out of his throne, he endeavours, panther-like, to tear his image in
man, and to put man, created after his image, upon blaspheming and
dishonouring his Maker.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, That malice must needs be great that <i>seeks its own fuel,
and provides or begs its own occasions, and those such as give no proper
provocation to his anger</i>. Of this temper is his malice. He did thus
with Job: he begs the commission, calumniates Job upon unjust surmises,
presseth still for a further power to hurt him, insomuch that
God expressly stints and bounds him—which shews how boundless he
would have been if left to his own will—and gives him at last an
open check, Job ii. 3, wherein he lays open the malice of his heart in
three things: [1.] His own pressing urgency: ‘Thou movedst me;’
[2.] His destructive fury: no less would serve than Job’s utter destruction;
[3.] Job’s innocency: all this without cause: ‘Thou movedst
me to destroy him without cause.’</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, That malice must needs be great that <i>will pursue
a small matter</i>. What small game will the devil play rather than
altogether sit out! If he can but trouble, or puzzle, or affright, yet
that he will do, rather than nothing; if he can, like an adder in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
path, but bite the heel, [Gen. xlix. 17,] though his head be bruised
for it, he will notwithstanding busy himself in it.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, That malice must be great which will <i>put itself
forth where it knows it can prevail nothing, but is certain of a disappointment</i>.
Thus did Satan tempt Christ. Those speeches, ‘if
thou be the Son of God,’ do not imply any doubt in Satan; he knew
what was prophesied of Christ, and what had been declared from
heaven in testification of him, so that he could not but be certain
he was God and man; and yet what base unworthy temptations doth
he lay before him, as ‘to fall down and worship him’! Was it that
Satan thought to prevail against him? No surely; but such was his
malice, that he would put an affront upon him, though he knew he
could not prevail against him.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, <i>The malice of wicked men is an argument of Satan’s
great malice</i>. They have an antipathy against the righteous, as the
wolf against the sheep, and upon that very ground, that they are
‘called out of the world.’ How great this fury is, all ages have
testified. This hath brought forth discord, revilings, slanders, imprisonments,
spoiling of goods, banishments, persecutions, tortures,
cruel deaths, as burning, racking, tearing, sawing asunder, and whatever
the wit of man could devise for a satisfaction to those implacable,
furious, murderous minds; and yet all this is done to men of the
same image and lineage with themselves, of the same religion with
themselves, as to the main; nay, sometime to men of their own
kindred, their own flesh and blood, and all to those that would live
peaceably in the land. What shall we say to these things? How
come men to put on a savage nature, to act the part of lions, leopards,
tigers, if not much worse? The reason of all we have, John viii.
54, ‘Ye are of your father the devil; he was a murderer from the
beginning:’ as also Gen. iii. 15, ‘I will put enmity between her seed
and thy seed so that all this shews what malice is in Satan’s heart,
who urgeth and provokes his instruments to such bloody hatreds.
Hence whoever were the agents [Rev. ii. 10] in imprisoning the saints,
the malice of Satan in stirring them up to it, makes him become the
author of it; ‘Satan shall cast some of you into prison.’</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s power.—His power as an angel considered.—That he lost
not that power by his fall.—His power as a devil.—Of his commission.—The
extent of his authority.—The efficacy of his power.—The
advantages which he hath for the management of it, from the number,
order, place, and knowledge of devils.</i></p>


<p><i>That Satan’s power is great</i>, is our next inquiry; where,</p>

<p>1. First, We will consider his power <i>as an angel</i>. In Ps. ciii. 20
angels are said ‘to excel in strength;’ and in ver. 21, as also Ps. cxlviii.
2, they are called ‘God’s host;’ which is more fully expressed, 1 Kings
xxii. 19, ‘I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne, and all the host of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left;’ which
phrase, though it import their order and observance, yet undoubtedly
the main of its intendment is to set forth their power, as hosts are the
strength of kings and nations. God himself, in putting on that title,
‘The Lord of hosts,’ makes it an evidence of his incomprehensible
power, that such armies of strong and mighty creatures are at his
command. But this only in the general. That which comes nearer
to a particular account of their strength, is that notion of a spirit,
by which they are frequently described, ‘He maketh his angels
spirits; his ministers flaming fire,’ Ps. civ. 4. The being of a spirit
is the highest our understanding is able to reach, and that it shews a
being very excellent, is manifest in this, that God is pleased to represent
himself to us under the notion of a spirit; not that he is truly
and properly such, but that this is the most excellent being that falls
under our apprehension. Besides that the term ‘spirit’ raiseth our
understanding to conceive a being of a high and extraordinary power,
it doth further tend to form our conceptions to some apprehensions
of their nature. [1.] From the knowledge that we have of our
own spirits. That our spirit is of a vast comprehension and activity,
our thoughts, desires, reasonings, and the particular undertakings
of some men of a raised spirit, do abundantly evidence. [2.] In that
it represents a spiritual being, freed from the clog and hindrance
of corporeity. Our own spirits are limited and restrained by our
bodies, as fire, an active element, is retarded and made sluggish by
matter unapt to serve its proper force, as when it is in a heap of earth;
which is also sufficiently pointed at in that opposition betwixt flesh
and blood, and principalities and powers, Eph. vi.; shewing that flesh
and blood are a disadvantage and hindrance to the activity of a
spirit. A spirit then, as incorporeal, may be conceived to move
easily without molestation, quickly, imperceptibly, and irresistibly.
[3.] This is yet further illustrated by the similitude of wind and fire,
which are, to the common experience of all, of very great force. And
it is yet further observable that the Scripture sometime speaks of the
power of angels in the abstract, choosing rather to call them ‘powers’
than powerful, ἐξουσίαι, Col. i. 16; clearly shewing that angels are
beings of vast strength, as indeed the actions done by them do abundantly
testify. Such was the destroying Sennacherib’s hosts in a
night, the opening the prison doors for Peter, the carrying Philip
in the air, and such other acts, which tend to the protection of the
faithful, or punishing of the wicked.</p>

<p>Though this may fully satisfy us that angels excel in strength, yet
the Scripture suggests another consideration relating to the office and
employment of angels, where their commission shews not only a liberty
for the exercise of this power, but also doth imply such a power as is
fit to be commissionated to such acts. These invisible beings are called
thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, Col. i. 16. It is indeed
a task beyond a sober undertaking to distinguish these words, and to
set their true bounds and marks of difference. This Augustine
acknowledged;<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> yet may we hence conclude, [1.] That these words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
imply a very great authority in angels; [2.] A power and strength
suitable to their employment, and that God furnished them with
power answerable to the work which he intended for them, in his
moving the heavens, and governing the world, &amp;c. However, in
some cases, God works by instruments every way disproportionable to
the service, ‘that the excellency of the power might be of God,’ [2
Cor. iv. 7;] yet, in the ordinary way of his working, he puts an innate,
suitable force in creatures, for the acts to be done by them; as there
is an innate power in the wind to blow, in the fire to burn, in herbs and
plants for medicinal uses. Thus may we conceive of angels, that God
using them as his host, his ‘ministers to do his pleasure,’ he hath
endowed them with an innate natural power for those great things
which he doth by them, which must not be supposed in the least derogatory
to the power of God, in his ways of mercies or judgments,
seeing all the strength of angels is originally from God. Hence is it
that all the names of angels which we read of in Scripture carry this
acknowledgment in their signification; Michael thus unfolds itself,
‘Who is like God;’ Gabriel thus, ‘The glory of God and therefore
may we suppose them not so much the proper names of angels,
but, as Calvin noteth, <i>Nomina ad captum nostrum indita</i>, Names
implying God’s great power in them.<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>Such a powerful spirit is Satan by creation. But because it will be
doubted lest his fall hath bereaved him of his excellency, and cast him
down from his strength, I shall evidence that he still retains the
same natural power. To which purpose it is not unfit to be observed,
[1.] That the same terms and names which were given to good
angels, to signify their strength and commission, Col. i. 16, and ii. 10,
are also given to Satan, Eph. vi. 12. Devils are called ‘principalities,’
‘powers,’ ‘rulers;’ and Col. ii. 15, they have the same names which
in ver. 10 were given to good angels, ‘he spoiled principalities and
powers.’ [2.] The Scripture gives particular instances of Satan’s
power and working: as his raising tempests in the air, commanding
fire from heaven—both which he did in prosecution of his malice
against Job; his carrying the bodies of men in the air—as he did with
Christ, hurrying him from the wilderness to the mountain, from
thence to the pinnacle of the temple; his breaking chains and fetters
of iron, Mark v. 4; his bringing diseases—instances whereof were that
crooked woman whom Satan had bowed together, Luke xiii. 16, and
the lunatic person, Luke ix. 31, with a great many more. [3.] It is
also observable that, notwithstanding, Satan’s fall hath made an
alteration as to the ends, uses, and office of his power; yet, nevertheless,
God makes use of this strength in him, not only as an executioner
of wrath against his enemies—as when he vexed Saul by this evil
spirit; and through this lying spirit, gave up Ahab to be deluded into
his ruin, and inflicted plagues upon Egypt, by sending evil angels
among them, 1 Sam. xvi. 14; 1 Kings xxii. 21; Ps. lxxviii. 49—but
also for the trial of his own servants. Thus was Job afflicted by
Satan, and Paul buffeted by his messenger.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, This power of his, as <i>a devil</i>, falls next under our
consideration, wherein are divers particulars to be noted: as,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>His commission and authority</i>. If any put that question
to him which the Jews did to Christ, ‘By what authority dost
thou these things?’ or, ‘Who gave thee this authority?’ we have the
answer in John xii. 24, and xvi. 11, where he is called, ‘the prince
of this world;’ and accordingly the Scripture speaks of a twofold
kingdom, of light and of darkness; and in this we hear of Satan’s seat
or throne, of his servants and subjects. Yea, that which is more, the
Scripture speaks of a kind of deity in Satan; he is called ‘the god of
this world,’ 2 Cor. iv. 4; which doth not only set forth the intolerable
pride and usurpation of Satan in propounding himself as such, so
drawing on poor blind creatures to worship him, but also discovers
his power, which by commission he hath obtained over the children
of disobedience, [Zanchius.] Hence doth he challenge it as a kind
of right and due from the poor Americans, and others, that they
should fall down and worship him; and upon this supposition was he
so intolerably presumptuous in offering the kingdoms of the world
to Christ for such a service and worship.</p>

<p>If it be questioned what Satan’s authority is, I shall answer it thus:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, His authority is not <i>absolute or unlimited</i>. He cannot
do what he pleaseth, and therefore we do find him begging leave of
God for the exerting of his power in particular cases, as when he was
‘a lying spirit’ in the mouth of Ahab’s prophets, and in every assault
he made upon Job; nay, he could not enter into the swine of the
Gadarenes till he had Christ’s commission for it.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Yet hath he a commission in general</i>—a standing
commission, as petty kings and governors had under the Roman
emperor, where they were authorised to exercise an authority and
power, according to the rules and directions given them. This is
clearly signified by those expressions, ‘they are captives at his will,’
[2 Tim. ii. 16,] and ‘given up to Satan,’ [1 Tim. i. 20,] as persons
excommunicated; and when men are converted, they are said to be
‘translated from his power,’ and put under another jurisdiction, in
the ‘kingdom of Christ,’ [Col. i. 13.] All which would have been
highly improper, if a commission for Satan, and an authority for
those works of darkness, had not been signified by them.</p>

<p>Next, let us view the <i>extent of this authority, both as to persons
and things</i>. In relation to persons, the boundary of his kingdom
reacheth as far as darkness. He rules in ‘the dark places of the
earth,’ or the darkness of this <i>world</i>; and therefore his kingdom is
hence denominated ‘a kingdom of darkness.’ This extends, we may
well imagine, as far as heathenism reacheth, where he is worshipped
as God, as far as any darkness of Mohammedanism stretcheth itself,
as far as the darkness of infidelity and blindness upon the hearts of
unconverted men; which, if summed up together, must needs take
up the greatest part of the world by far; which is acknowledged, not
only by that large expression world, ‘prince of the world,’ &amp;c., but
also by that prophetic speech of Rev. xi. 15, ‘The kingdoms of this
world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ,’ which
acknowledgeth they had not been so before, in the sense wherein we
now speak.</p>

<p>Neither is his kingdom so bounded but that he also can, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
allowed, make excursions and inroads into the kingdom of Christ, so
far as to molest, disturb, and annoy his subjects; as the kings of any
nation, besides the power which they exercise in their proper jurisdiction,
may molest their neighbours. And Christ so far permits
this as is useful to his own designs, yet still with straiter reserves
and limitations to Satan, and a resolved rescue and conquest for his
own people.</p>

<p>If we inquire the extent of his power in relation to things, we find
the air in a peculiar manner permitted to him; so that he is named
by it, as by one of his chief royalties, ‘the prince of the power of the
air.’ We find also death, with the powers of it, given up to him;
so that this is a <i>periphrasis</i> of him, ‘He that hath the power of
death,’ Heb. ii. 14. And if we take notice of his large proffer to
Christ of the kingdoms of the world, ‘All this will I give thee,’
we may imagine that his commission reacheth far this way, as rewards
and encouragements to his service; which we will the readilier
entertain when we find that, by God’s allowance, wicked men have
their ‘portion in this life,’ and that these are called ‘their good
things.’<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>3. Thirdly, Let us proceed a step further, to <i>the efficacy of this
authority</i>; which also,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>Upon wicked men is no less remarkable than is his commission</i>.
He is called ‘the strong man,’ [Luke xi. 21,] in reference
to their hearts, which he fortifies, as so many castles and garrisons,
against God. He also ‘rules in them’ without control; his suggestions
and temptations are as laws to them; he ‘fills their hearts,’
Acts v. 3, with his designs, and raiseth their affections to a high
and greedy pursuit of them; he works in them, and by an inward
force doth hurry them on to achieve his enterprises, in all this ensnaring
and captivating them ‘at his pleasure,’ Eph. ii. 2; 2 Tim.
ii. 26.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>The saints, which are subjects of another kingdom,
are still fearing, complaining, watching, praying, and spreading out
their hands, with lifting up their eyes to heaven for help against him</i>.
They complain of violence and restless assaults from him; they are
sensible that he can suggest evil thoughts, and follow them with
incessant importunities; that he can draw a darkness upon their
understanding by bribing their wills and affections against them;
that he can disturb their duties, and that because of him they cannot
do the good they would. Many a fear doth he beget in their hearts;
many a disquiet hour have they from him; their flesh hath no rest,
and happy are they if they escape from him without broken bones;
many excellent ones have been cast down by him, and for a time have
been like dead men. It is sad to see so just a person as Lot under
his feet; so choice a saint as David wounded almost to the death; so
high an apostle as Peter, by force and fear from him, to open his
mouth with curses and imprecations in the denial of his Saviour; to
say nothing of the buffetings of others, which was sufficiently wearisome
to Paul, and described by ‘a thorn in the flesh,’ 2 Cor. xii. 7;
which, if a learned man think right, is compared, by a metaphor, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
those sharp stakes upon which Christians were cruelly spitted and
burnt.<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>His quick and ready accomplishment</i> is a further
proof of the efficacy of his power. No sooner had God given him a
commission in reference to Job, but he quickly raiseth the tempest,
brings down the house, slays his children, brings fire from heaven;
and, which would seem strange, hath the troops of the Sabeans and
Chaldeans at his beck, as if they had been listed under his known
command; so that in a little time he puts his malice into act.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, If any would slight all this, as being the force of
principalities and powers against flesh and blood, we may see he hath
so much strength and confidence <i>as to grapple with an angel of light,
as he did in the contesting for Moses his body</i>, Jude 9. This was
a created angel, else he durst not sure have brought a ‘railing
accusation;’ but in that he strove, and railingly accused, it shews he
wanted not a daring boldness to second his commission and power.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, It will be also requisite to lay open the <i>advantages he
hath in the management of all this power</i>, which are great; as,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>The multitude of devils</i>. That there are many is not
denied, upon the evidence of seven cast out of Mary Magdalene, and
the legion which were settled in one poor man at once. It may be
we may not credit the devil’s own account of his strength so much as
to believe that their number was exactly answerable to a Roman
legion, which, if some speak right, was 6666; yet there being so
plain an allusion to a Roman legion, and the Scripture in the recital
favouring it so far as to consent to a truth in that part of the story,
we can do no less than conclude that the number of devils in that
person was a very great number, and so great, that the similitude of
legion was proper to express it by. Besides, if the Scripture had been
silent in this particular, our reason would have clearly drawn that
conclusion from such premises as these, that he is the ‘god’ of the
world, and rules in the ‘children of disobedience;’ for whatsoever we
conceive of his power, we cannot think him omnipotent or omnipresent,
these being the incommunicable attributes of the great
Creator of all things, in which no creature can share with God.
Being then assured that he is the tempter of all men, and that he
cannot be in all places at once, we must needs apprehend the devils to
be many, as is signified by that expression, ‘the devil and his angels.’</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, He hath also an advantage for the executing of his
designs, from <i>that order, which from the fore-mentioned grounds we
must be forced to conceive to be among devils</i>. I know the bold
determination of the order of angels by Dionysius is justly rejected,
not only by Irenæus and Augustine,<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> but also by the generality of
protestants, who upon that and other grounds of like presumption do
reject that author as not being the true Dionysius the Areopagite.
Neither do some of our protestant authors, as Chamier and others,
admit the government of angels to be monarchical, which supposition
the papists would gladly make use of, as a foundation whereon to
establish the universal headship of the pope, being a thing which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
Dionysius himself, as Chamier affirms, never dreamt of.<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> Yet do
none of these authors deny an order among the angels, but willingly
grant it, as clearly implied from the term <i>archangel</i> used by Paul,
1 Thes. iv. 16,<a id="FNanchor_85_85" href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> and from their being called God’s host or army, where
order is necessary for the right management of their strength, and
confusion the way to the ruin of their designs. The thing they dislike
is, the bold and peremptory determination of the particular orders
among them, and the assignment of the several charges, employments,
and stations to each; which whosoever shall do, must needs be guilty
of ‘intruding into things which he hath not seen.’<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> It would upon
the same score be a presumptuous folly to make such a determination
of the several ranks and particular employments of devils. Yet this
hindereth not, but with a warrantable sobriety we may believe in the
general that there is an order among the devils. Not only do these
expressions, ‘Beelzebub the prince of devils,’ ‘the devil and his angels,’
and in that they are called ‘principalities and powers,’ warrant us so
to think, but the fore-mentioned considerations about the multitude
of devils will force our reason to an assent: for if they must be many,
because all mankind is sensible of their assaults, they must have also
an order in the management of their temptations—without which
their designs of cruelty and malice must, at least in great part, fall to
the ground.<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> Neither do I know well how those authors may be
justly blamed, who proceed a little further in their suppositions, to
tell us, as most probable,<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> that these infernal spirits do share the
world among them, and are allotted to several countries and places,
as their own proper charge and jurisdiction; for what other interpretation
those passages in Dan. x. 13 can receive I cannot see: the
prince of the kingdom of Persia withstanding the angel one and
twenty days; and his help in that opposition from Michael, cannot, if
things be well weighed, be properly understood of Cambyses the son
of Cyrus, or a contest with any man. However, if we let this go as a
thing uncertain, because this interpretation is denied by some,<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> yet that
which is spoken of their order in the general, and the advantage these
spirits have against us upon that consideration, seems to be past denial.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, The advantage <i>of place among armies is reckoned
much</i>. Satan seems to have something this way as an advantage of
ground, in that he is styled spiritual wickedness in high places.<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
What advantage high places may be to devils and spirits we cannot
further imagine, than that they, being thus above us and about us in
the air, see and know our ways and actions, and so receive information
from thence for their malicious proceedings against us.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, But his greatest advantage is from <i>his knowledge</i>,
which I shall a little explain in the following chapter.
</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>




<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>That Satan hath a great measure of knowledge, proved by comparing
him with the knowledge of Adam in innocency, and by his titles.—Of
his knowledge, natural, experimental, and accessory.—Of his
knowledge of our thoughts.—How far he doth not know them,
and how far he doth, and by what means.—Of his knowledge of
things future, and by what ways he doth conjecture them.—The
advantages in point of temptation that he hath by his knowledge.</i></p>


<p>In the discovery of Satan’s knowledge, I shall first give evidence and
demonstration thereof. To which purpose—</p>

<p>1. Let us consider <i>the knowledge of Adam in innocency</i>; which
being found to be great, it will thence be easily concluded that Satan’s
knowledge is far greater. Two notable discoveries we have of Adam’s
knowledge, the one was his giving of names to all creatures, Gen.
ii. 29, which was not only a sign of his dominion, but also a notable
instance of his understanding, seeing the names were given according
to the natures of creatures; whereof Bochartus gives a large account,
as the camel is called גמל, because it is apt to repay injuries; the
kite, דאה, from its sharpness of sight; the pelican is named קאת, from
its usual vomiting, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_91_91" href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> The consideration of the aptness of names
imposed on creatures made Plato acknowledge that it was a work
above ordinary capacity. The other discovery of Adam’s knowledge
was his knowledge of the original of Eve at first sight, Gen ii. 23; he
said, ‘This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,’ &amp;c.
This instance Luther made use of to prove the knowledge that we
shall have of one another in heaven; which shews that Adam’s
understanding was then incomparably more sublime than ours, and
of a nearer approach to the knowledge which a state of glory shall
furnish us withal. To this might be added a further proof from the
rare inventions and excellent discoveries that some raised wits have
made, of things that have laid deep and far out of the view of common
capacities. As also those views, sights, and more than ordinary comprehensions
which the souls of men have had, when they were a little
freed from the clog and hindrance of the body, either in ecstasies or
by approaching death; all which put together will go far to prove a
very great measure of knowledge in Satan, if we take along with us
this foundation, that in all the works of God we find the highest
knowledge in the noblest being. Living creatures are more excellent
than stones or trees, and therefore hath God furnished them with
senses, and hath also distinguished them by higher degrees of sagacity,
according to their excellency above others. Thus the ape, fox,
elephant, &amp;c., have such abilities above the worm and fly, &amp;c., that
some have questioned whether they had not some lower degrees of
reason: yet as these are below man, so doth his reason far excel their
greatest quickness of sense. Angels are a higher being than man—for
he made him ‘lower than the angels’—and consequently their
knowledge is proportionably greater. So that if Adam in innocency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
understood the nature of things, how much more exactly and fully
must we imagine Satan to know them!</p>

<p>2. Secondly, But the proof is more full and direct, from those
<i>appellations and titles which the Scripture and the experience of men
have put upon him</i>; his usual name, Δαίμων, <i>quasi</i> Δαήμων, which—in
Mat. viii. 31; Mark v. 12; Rev. xvi. 14—we translate <i>devil</i>, properly
signifieth one that is wise, knowing, or skilful. And however
the wickedness of that spirit hath so far dishonoured this word, that
it is always, as some think, used to signify ‘unclean spirits;’ yet still
it carries an evidence of their nature in reference to knowledge, that
though they are wicked creatures, yet are they wise and knowing. It
is said, Gen. iii. 1, ‘The serpent was more subtle than any beast of
the field;’ which, though it be true literally of the serpent, whose
wisdom and subtlety naturalists have abundantly noted, yet that
expression hath an eye upon Satan, who was the principal agent; and
the serpent there is called subtle, as influenced by Satan, whose instrument
he was:<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> which we may believe, not only upon the credit of
Austin and Lyra, but more securely upon the testimony of other
scriptures, which name him ‘the old serpent,’ Rev. xvii. 9, and impute
all that craft in the management of that temptation to a particular
remarkable skill and subtlety of Satan. ‘The serpent beguiled Eve
through subtlety,’ 2 Cor. xi. 3; and, if Beza conjecture right, the
appellation Δαίμων do so fitly suit this history of the tree of knowledge,
that the title of knowledge seems to be given him for this singular
masterpiece of craft.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, That Satan hath great knowledge is by these arguments
discovered; but if further inquiry be made into the <i>nature of his knowledge</i>,
we shall be nearer to a satisfaction in this particular; and here
we may observe a threefold knowledge in Satan.</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>A natural knowledge</i>; which the schoolmen have distinguished
into these two: [1.] <i>An evening knowledge</i>, which he received
from things created, whereby the <i>species</i> of things were impressed
upon his mind, and so received, being a knowledge <i>à posteriori</i>, from
the effects of things; which, because it is more dark and obscure than
that which ariseth from the causes of things, they termed evening
knowledge. [2.] The other is <i>morning knowledge</i>, which is a knowledge
of things in the power and wisdom of God, in which he saw the
ideas and images of all things. This knowledge they prefer before the
other, as lines and figures are better known from mathematical instruction
than by their bare tract as written in dust.<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Besides this he hath an <i>experimental knowledge</i>;
which is the improvement of that natural stock, by further acquisitions
and attainments. And indeed Satan had very high advantages
for an increase of knowledge. He had a great stock to begin withal;
he hath had fit and suitable objects to work upon in his contemplations,
so that by comparing things with things in so large a field of
variety, and that for so many years together, it cannot be but that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
should be grown more experienced and subtle than he was at first;
and the Scripture doth fairly countenance this supposition, by telling
us of his devices, 2 Cor. ii. 11; of his wiles, Eph. vi. 11; and of his
depths, Rev. ii. 24.<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> All which phrases imply that Satan hath so
studied the point of temptation, that he hath now, from long experience
and observation, digested it into an art and method, and that with
such exactness that it is become a mystery and a depth, much covered
and concealed from the notice and observation of men.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, To both the former may be added another knowledge,
which because it is from another spring, I may call it an <i>accessory
knowledge</i>, consisting in occasional discoveries made to him, either
when God is pleased to make known so much of his mind and purpose,
as he employs him, as an instrument or servant, to execute, as he did
in the case of Job and Ahab; or when he informs himself from the
Scriptures, or catcheth hints of knowledge from the church and the
ordinances thereof. If good angels have an increase of knowledge this
way, as is evident they have, ‘for to principalities and powers in
heavenly places is made known by the church the manifold wisdom
of God,’ Eph. iii. 10, we cannot but imagine that Satan hath some
addition of knowledge from such discoveries. While we are upon this
point, it will be necessary to offer some satisfaction to two questions.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> 1. First, Whether Satan knows our thoughts?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> 1. It is undoubtedly God’s prerogative to know the thoughts.
He knows them intuitively, which is beyond the power of any creature:
Jer. xvii. 9, ‘Who can know it?’ This is a challenge to all, implying
the utter impossibility of it to any but to God alone; ‘I the Lord
search the heart;’ he knows the most inward thoughts: Rev. ii. 23,
‘I am he which searcheth the reins, and the heart;’ he knows them
evidently and certainly: Heb. iv. 13, ‘All things are naked and open<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
before him with whom we have to do.’ Those secret thinkings and
intendments which are hid from others, and which we ourselves cannot
distinctly read, because of their secret intricacy or confusedness,
yet the very inside and outside of them are uncased, cut up and
anatomised by his eye; in all which expressions God is careful to
reserve this to himself, ‘I the Lord do it,’ or ‘I am he, &amp;c., that
searcheth;’ and signifies that none else is able to do the like.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> 2. Yet Satan can do much this way; for if we consider how
he can come so near to our spirits, as to communicate his injections
to us, and that he often entertains a dispute with us in this secret way
of access that he hath to our thoughts; if we observe his arguings, his
answers and replies to our refusals, so direct, so pertinent, so continued,
we shall be constrained to grant that he can do more this way than is
commonly imagined. That I may explain this with a due respect to
God’s prerogative of knowing the heart, I shall,</p>

<p>1. First, <i>Shew that there are two things which are clearly out of
Satan’s reach</i>. [1.] Our future thoughts; he cannot tell what shall be
our thoughts for time to come. He may possibly adventure to tell
what suggestions he resolves to put into our hearts, but what shall be
our resolves and determinations thereupon he knows not. This is
singled out as one part of God’s prerogative, that he knoweth the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
determinate purposes and resolves of the heart aforehand, because he
turneth the heart as he pleaseth, Prov. xxi. 1. [2.] Our present
formed thoughts, the immediate and imminent<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> acts of the mind he
cannot directly see into. He may tell what floating thinkings he hath
put into our heart, but our own proper thoughts, or formed resolves,
he cannot directly view. This is also particularly insisted on as proper
to God alone: John ii. 24, 25, ‘Christ knew all men,’ so directly,
that ‘he needed not that any should testify of man.’ This Satan
stands in need of; he sometimes knows men and their thoughts, but
he needs a sign or notification of these thoughts, and cannot immediately
look into them. The reason why Christ needed not this, is rendered
thus: ‘For he knew what was in man,’ Mat. xii. 25, that is,
intuitively he knew his thoughts, and could immediately read them.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, <i>I shall endeavour to explain how much, or how far
he can pry into our thoughts</i>. Several things are granted which argue
Satan can go a great way toward a discovery. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>That he knows the objects in our fancy or phantasms</i>,
and this as clearly as we do behold things with our eyes. And the proof
given hereof is this: that there are diabolical dreams, in which the
devil cannot create new species, and such as our senses were never
acquainted withal, as to make a blind man dream of colours, but that
he can only call forth and set in order those objects, of which our imagination
doth retain the shadows or impressions; and this he could
not do if he did not visibly behold them in our fancy.<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, It is certain he knows <i>his own suggestions and
temptations darted into our minds</i>, upon which he can at present know
what our thoughts are busied upon.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, He knows <i>the secret workings of our passions, as love,
desire, fear</i>, &amp;c., because these depend upon, or are in a concomitancy
of the motions of the blood and spirits, which he can easily discern,
though their motions and workings may be kept secret from the observation
of all bystanders.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, Some go further, as Scotus, (<i>referente Barthol.
Sybilla</i>,)<a id="FNanchor_98_98" href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> supposing that he knows what is in our thoughts at any
time, only he knows not to what these thoughts incline; but I leave
this to those that can determine it certainly. In the meantime I
proceed,</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, <i>To shew what a guessing faculty he hath of what he
doth not directly know</i>. He hath such grounds and advantages for
conjecture, that he seldom fails of finding our mind. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>His long experience hath taught him what usually men
do think</i>, in such cases as are commonly before them. By a cunning
observation of their actions and ways he knows this.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>He by study and observation knows our temper and
inclination</i>, and consequently what temptations do most suit them, and
how we do ordinarily entertain them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, He knows this the more, <i>by taking notice of our
prayers, our complainings and mournings over our defects and miscarriages</i>.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>He is quick and ready to take notice of any exterior
sign, by which the mind is signified</i>, as the pulse, the motion of the
body, the change of the countenance, all which do usually shew the
assent or dissent of the mind, and at least tell him what entertainment
his offers have in our thoughts.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, Being so quick-sighted, he can understand <i>those particular
signs which would escape the observation of the wisest men</i>.<a id="FNanchor_99_99" href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
There are some things small in themselves, and therefore unobserved,
which yet to wise men are very great <i>indicia</i> of things. The like may
be said of us, in reference to our inclinations, our acceptance or resistance
of temptations, which yet he hath curiously marked out.</p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, No doubt but he hath ways to <i>put us upon a discovery
of our thoughts, while we conceal them</i>, as by continuing and prosecuting
temptations or suggestions, till our trouble or passions do some
way discover how it is with us. By all which it appears that his
guessings and conjectures do seldom fail him. It is now time to speak
to the other question, which is,</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> 2. Whether and how far Satan knows things to come?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> To this I shall return answer in these two conclusions:</p>

<p><i>Conclusion</i> 1. First, There is a way of knowing future things, <i>which
is beyond the knowledge of devils, and proper only to God</i>, Isa. xli. 23;
there God puts the competition betwixt himself and idols, about the
truth of a deity, upon this issue, that ‘he that can shew the things
that are to come hereafter, he is God;’ which because they cannot do,
he doth hereby evince them to be no gods. If Satan could truly and
properly have done this, he had had a plea for a godhead. In divine
predictions two things are to be considered. [1.] The matter foretold;
when the events of things contingent, and as to second causes casual,
depending upon indeterminate causes, are foretold. [2.] The manner;
when these things are not uncertainly, or conjecturally, or darkly, but
clearly, certainly, infallibly, and fully predicted. Of this nature are
divine predictions, which Satan cannot perform, nor yet the angels in
heaven.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion</i> 2. Secondly, <i>Yet Satan hath such advantages for the
knowledge of future things, and such means and helps for a discovery
of them, that his conjectures have often come to pass</i>.</p>

<p>[1.] First, He knows <i>the causes of things, which are secret to us</i>.
Upon which he seems to foretell many things strange to us; as a
physician may foretell the effects, workings, and issues of a disease,
as seeing them in the causes, which would pass for little less than
prophecy among the vulgar. Thus an astrologer foretells eclipses,
which would be taken for a divine excellency, where the knowledge
of the ground of these foretellings had not taken away the wonder.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Many things are made known to him <i>by immediate
divine revelation</i>. We know not the intercourse betwixt God and
Satan in the matter of Job. Satan having obtained his commission to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
afflict him, might have made a long prophecy of what should come
to pass in reference to Job, his children and substance. How many
such predictions he might make, we little know.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, He hath <i>a deep insight in affairs of kingdoms and
states</i>, and so might, from his experience and observation, easily conjecture
mutations and alterations. A politician may do much this way.
For aught we know, Satan’s prophecy, in the likeness of Samuel, to
Saul, of his ruin, and the translation of his kingdom to David, might
be no more than a conjectural conclusion, from his comparing the order
of the present providence with former threatenings and promises.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, He hath <i>a greater understanding of Scripture prophecies,
than ordinarily the wisest men have</i>, so that at second hand he
might be able to foretell what shall come to pass; whilst we that do
not so clearly see into Scripture predictions, may not be able to find out
the matter. Hence by oracle he foretold Alexander of his success,
which he knew from the prophecy of Daniel, chap. xi., long before.<a id="FNanchor_100_100" href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, He hath advantage from his nature <i>as a spirit, by
which he overhears and sees the private actings, complottings, and
preparations of men in reference to certain undertakings</i>, and can
easily, by his agents, communicate such counsels or resolves in remote
countries and kingdoms, which must pass for real predictions, if the
event answer accordingly.</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, <i>He can foretell, and with probability of success, such
things as he by temptation is about to put men upon, especially seeing
he can choose such instruments as he, from experience, knows are not
likely to fail his enterprise</i>.</p>

<p>[7.] Seventhly, To this may be added, <i>the way and manner by
which he expresseth himself, either in doubtful or enigmatical terms,
or in general expressions</i>, which may be applied to the event, what
way soever it should happen. Of these, authors have observed many
instances, which were superfluous to enumerate.<a id="FNanchor_101_101" href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>Satan’s knowledge being thus explained, it is easy to imagine what
an advantage it is to him in the management of his temptations. For,</p>

<p>First, He by this means knows our tempers and dispositions.</p>

<p>Secondly, And what is most likely to prevail with us.</p>

<p>Thirdly, How inclinable we are upon any motion made to us, and
what hope to gain upon us.</p>

<p>Fourthly, He knows fit times, seasons, and advantages against us.</p>

<p>Fifthly, He knows how to pursue suggestions, and can choose strong
reasons to urge us withal.</p>

<p>Sixthly, He knows how to delude our senses, to disturb our
passions.</p>

<p>Seventhly, He knows all the ways and arts of affrightments, vexations,
disquietments, hindrances, and disturbances of duty.</p>

<p>[8.] Eighthly, He by this means is furnished <i>with skill for his
public cheats and delusions in the world</i>; how to amuse, astonish,
and amaze men into errors and mistakes, which he hath always
endeavoured with very great success in the world, as we shall see
hereafter.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Instances of Satan’s power.—Of witchcraft, what it is.—Satan’s
power argued from thence.—Of wonders.—Whether Satan can do
miracles?—An account of what he can do that way.—His power
argued from apparitions and possessions.</i></p>


<p>I shall add, in the fifth place, some particular instances of his
power, in which I shall insist upon these four—witchcraft, wonders,
apparitions, and possessions.</p>

<p>1. First, <i>Witchcraft</i> affords a very great discovery of Satan’s
power. But because some give such interpretations of witchcraft,
as, if true, would wholly take away the force of this instance, I shall
first endeavour to establish a true notion of witchcraft; and secondly,
from thence argue Satan’s power.</p>

<p>(1.) First, Though the being of witches is not directly denied,
because the authority of Scripture—Exod. xxii. 18; Deut. xviii. 10,
&amp;c.—hath determined beyond controversy that such there are; yet
some will allow no other interpretation of the word,<a id="FNanchor_102_102" href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> than a skill and
practice in the art of poisoning, because the Septuagint doth interpret
the Hebrew word, מכשפה, by φάρμακον, <i>veneficam</i>; which apprehension
they strengthen by the authority of Josephus,<a id="FNanchor_103_103" href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> who giveth
this account of the law, ‘Let none of the children of Israel use any
deadly poison, or any drug wherewith he may do hurt,’ &amp;c. It is
easy to observe that this conceit ariseth from a great inobservancy of
the reason of the application of these words, φάρμακος and <i>veneficus</i>,
to witchcraft, in Greek and Latin authors.</p>

<p>Witchcrafts were supposed to be helped forward by the strength of
several herbs, and these, by incantations and other ceremonies at
their gathering, imagined to attain a poisonous and evil quality or
efficacy for such effects as were intended to be produced by them, as
appears by Ovid, Virgil, and other authors.<a id="FNanchor_104_104" href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> Hence was it that the
word φάρμακος became applicable to any sort of witchcraft. To this
may be added, that such persons were resorted to for help against
diseases, [<i>vide</i> Leigh. Crit. Sac. in Voc.] As also that they used unguents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
for transportations. Hence Godwin [Jew. Antiq., lib. iv. cap. 10]
renders φαρμάκους by <i>unguentarios</i>. Diascorides [Cap. de Rhamno]
hath an expression to this purpose, ‘that the branch of that tree,
being placed before the doors, doth drive away τῶν φαρμάκων κακουργίας,
witchcrafts.’ It were ridiculous to say it drives away poisonings;
which is a sufficient evidence that the Grecians used that word to
signify another kind of witchcraft than that which this mistake would
establish. Besides this, the Scripture doth afford two strong arguments
against this interpretation of witchcraft.</p>

<p>[1.] That this word is ranked with others, as being of the same
alliance, which will carry the apprehensions of any considerate man
to effects done by the help of Satan, in an unusual way, as Deut.
xviii. 10, ‘There shall not be found among you any that maketh his
son or his daughter to pass through the fire’—this is not the consuming
of their children to Moloch, but by way of lustration, a mock
baptism, a piece of witchcraft, to preserve from violent death—‘or that
useth divination, an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,’
&amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_105_105" href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> The very neighbourhood of the witch will tell us that this
witch must be a diviner, divination being the general term, comprehending
the seven particulars following.<a id="FNanchor_106_106" href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> It would be a harsh
straining to put in the poisoner, in the sense of our opposites, among
the diviners. Yet the second argument is more cogent, which is this:
That among those whom Pharaoh called together to encounter with
Moses, Exod. vii. 11, we find witches or sorcerers expressed by the
same word, מכשפים, which is used in Exod. xxii. and Deut. xviii.
What can more certainly fix the interpretation of the word than this
place, where the end of Pharaoh’s calling them together was, not to
poison Moses and Aaron, but by enchantment to outvie them in point
of miracles? which will shew that witchcraft is not poisoning, but
the doing of strange acts by the aid of Satan. Neither was this the
act of one man—who might possibly, together with that present age,
be under a mistake concerning witches, though it be a thing not to be
supposed—but long after him, Nebuchadnezzar, in Dan. ii. 4, being
astonished with his dreams, calls for the sorcerers or witches, and
magicians, to give him the interpretation; which had been a matter
very improper for them, if their skill had lain only in mixing
poisons.<a id="FNanchor_107_107" href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>When we have thus silenced this imagination, we have yet another
to encounter with, and that is, Of those that think these witches, of
which the fore-cited texts do speak, are but mere cheats, and by some
tricks of delusion and legerdemain pretend they can do things which
indeed they cannot do at all; and yet finding death threatened to
such, which, in a business of mere juggling, would seem too great a
severity, they have framed this answer to it,<a id="FNanchor_108_108" href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> that the death is threatened,
not for juggling, but for their presumptuous and blasphemous
undertaking to do things that belong to a divine power, and for taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
his name in vain. Or, as others are pleased to say,<a id="FNanchor_109_109" href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> though they have
no real power, they are justly punished for the belief they have, that
they can do such mischief, joined with their purpose to do it, if they
can.</p>

<p>In answer to this apprehension, I shall not much insist upon these
reasons, which yet are sufficiently weak—the latter accusing God’s
laws of unreasonable severity, and the former accusing them of unnecessary
redundancy, seeing enough in other places is provided against
blasphemers<a id="FNanchor_110_110" href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>—but shall offer a consideration or two, which I judge
will be of force to rectify the mistake.</p>

<p>[1.] First, Though it cannot be denied but that a great many cheats
there have been in all ages, by which men have endeavoured to raise
the repute and esteem of their own skill and excellencies, or for other
base ends; yet, from hence to conclude that all these things that have
been done under the name of witchcraft were such, must be an unsufferable
piece of insolence; not only denying that credit which all
sober men owe to history, to the constant belief of all ages, to the
faithfulness and wisdom of judges, jurors, witnesses, laws, and sanctions,
but also dangerously overthrowing all our senses; so that at
this rate we may well question whether we really eat, drink, move,
sleep, and anything else that we do. This reason is urged by grave
and serious men.<a id="FNanchor_111_111" href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, It cannot be imagined that such things are merely
delusory, where the voluntary confessions of so many have accused
themselves and others, not of thinking or juggling, but of really acting
and doing such things—with such circumstances as have particularised
time, place, thing, and manner.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, The real effects done by the power of witchcraft shew
it not to be delusion. Such are the transportation of persons many
miles from their habitations, and leaving them there; their telling
things done in remote places; raising of storms and tempests; vomiting
of pins, needles, stones, cloth, leather, and such like; and these,
some of them, attested by sober and intelligent persons who were
eye-witnesses. Large accounts you have of these in Bodinus, Sprengerius,
and several others that have borrowed these relations from
them.<a id="FNanchor_112_112" href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>The notion of poisonings, or delusory jugglings, being below what
the Scripture intends to set forth as witchcraft, it is evident that witchcraft
is a power of doing great things by the aid of the devil; by
which our way is open to improve this instance, to demonstrate—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
which was the second thing promised—that Satan’s power must be
great. For,</p>

<p>[1.] First, It is acknowledged that a great part of those things that
are done in this matter, as concurrent with, or helpful toward the
promoting of such acts, are Satan’s proper works—as the troubling of
the air, raising storms, apparitions, various shapes and appearances,
transportations from place to place, and a great many more things of
wonder and amazement, all which exceed human power.<a id="FNanchor_113_113" href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Many things of wonder done by such persons, to
which some suppose the secret powers of herbs or things contribute
their natural aids or concurrence, are evidences of Satan’s deep knowledge
of and insight into natural causes. Of this nature is that
ointment with which witches are said to besmear themselves in order
to their transportation; the power and efficacy whereof is by some
imagined to consist in this, that it keeps the body tenantable and in a
fit condition to receive the soul by re-entry after such separations, as,
by all circumstances are concluded, have been really made in pursuit
of those visionary perambulations and transactions; which things, if
they be so—as they are not improbable—witches have them from
Satan’s discovery, and they are to be ascribed to his power.<a id="FNanchor_114_114" href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Those actions that are most properly the witch’s own
actions, and in which the power of hurting doth, as some suppose,
reside, are notwithstanding either awakened or influenced by Satan;
so though we grant, what some would have, that the power of hurting
is a natural power, and a venomous magnetism of the witch, and
that her imagination, by her eye darts those malignant beams which
produce real hurts upon men—after the manner of the imagination’s
force upon a child in the womb, which hath, as by daily experience
and history is confirmed, produced marks, impressions, deformities,
and wounds—and that Satan doth but cheat the witch into a belief
of his aid in that matter; that with a greater advantage he may make
use of her power, without which he could do nothing; yet even this
speaks his ability, in that at least he doth awaken and raise up that
magical force which otherwise would be asleep, and so puts the sword
into their hand. Yet some attribute far more to him—to wit, the
infusion of a poisonous ferment—by that action of sucking the witch
in some part of the body—by which not only her imagination might
be heightened by poisonous streams breathed in, which might infect
blood and spirits with a noxious tincture.<a id="FNanchor_115_115" href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>2. The second grand instance of his power I shall produce from
those actions of <i>wonder and astonishment which he sometime performs,
which indeed have been so great that they have occasioned that
question</i>—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>Whether Satan can do miracles?</p>

<p>To this we answer—</p>

<p>(1.) <i>That God alone can work miracles</i>, a miracle being a real
act, done visibly, and above the power of nature. Such works some
have ranked into three heads:<a id="FNanchor_116_116" href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> [1.] Such as created power cannot
produce; as to make the sun stand still or go backward. [2.] Such
as are in themselves produceable by nature,<a id="FNanchor_117_117" href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> but not in such an order;
as to make the dead to live, and those that were born blind to see,
which is strongly argued, John ix. 32, to be above human power;
and, John x. 21, to be above the power of devils. [3.] Such as are
the usual works of nature, yet produced, above the principles and
helps of nature, as to cure a disease by a word or touch.</p>

<p>Things that are thus truly and properly miraculous are peculiarly
works of God; neither can it be imagined, that since he hath been
pleased to justify his commands, ways, and messages, by such mighty
acts—2 Cor. xii. 12; Heb. ii. 4; John x. 38—and also hath been put
to it, to justify himself and his sole supreme being and godhead from
false competitors—Ps. lxxxvi. 10, and lxxii. 18—by his miraculous
works, it cannot be imagined, I say, that he would permit any created
being, much less Satan, to do such things.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>Though Satan cannot do things miraculous, yet he
can do things wonderful and amazing—mira non miracula</i>. And in
this point lies the danger of delusion, as Christ foretells: Mat. xxiv.
24, ‘False Christs shall arise, and shew great signs and wonders.’ In
2 Thes. ii. 4, the apostle tells us, ‘The coming of antichrist shall be
with all power, and signs, and wonders’—that is, as some interpret,<a id="FNanchor_118_118" href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
with the power of signs and wonders; which, however they be lying,
both in reference to the design they drive at—which is to propagate
errors—and also in their own nature, being truly such, in respect of
their form, false as miracles, being indeed no such matter, but
juggling cheats; yet, notwithstanding, there is no small cunning and
working of Satan in them, insomuch that the uncautious and injudicious
are ‘deceived by those wonders that he hath power to do,’ Rev.
xiii. 13. In this matter, though we are not able to give a particular
account of these underground actions, yet thus much we may say—</p>

<p>[1.] First, That in many cases his great acts, that pass for miracles,
are no more <i>but deceptions of sense</i>. Naturalists have shewn several
feats and knacks of this kind. Jo. Bap. Porta<a id="FNanchor_119_119" href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> hath a great many
ways of such deceptions, by lamps and the several compositions of oils,
by which not only the colours of things are changed, but men appear
without heads, or with the heads of horses, &amp;c. The like deceptions
are wrought by glasses of various figures and shapes. If art can do
such things, much more can Satan.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He can mightily work upon <i>the fancy and imagination</i>;
by which means men are abused into a belief of things that are
not; as in dreams, the fancy presents things which are really imagined
to be done and said, whenas they are visions of the night, which vanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
when the man is awake; or as in melancholy persons, the fancy of
men doth so strongly impose upon them, that they believe strange
absurd things of themselves—that they have horns on their head, that
they are made of glass, that they are dead, and what not. If fancy,
both asleep and awake, may thus abuse men into an apprehension of
impossible things, and that with confidence, no wonder if Satan, whose
power reacheth thus far, as was before proved, doth take this advantage
for the amusing of men with strange things. Nebuchadnezzar
his judgment, Dan. iv. 25, whereby he was ‘driven from men, and ate
grass as oxen,’ was not a metamorphosis, or real change into an ox.
This all expositors reject as too hard. Neither seems it to be only
his extreme necessity and low estate, whereby he seemed to be little
better than a beast, though Calvin favour this interpretation;<a id="FNanchor_120_120" href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> but
by that expression, ver. 25, ‘then my understanding came to me,’
it seems evident, as most commentators think, that his understanding
was so changed in that punishment that he imagined himself to be a
beast, and behaved himself accordingly, by eating grass, and lying in
the open fields. There are several stories to this purpose of strange
transformations, as the bodies of men into asses, and other beasts,
which Augustine thinks to be nothing else but the devil’s power upon
the fancy.<a id="FNanchor_121_121" href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, There are wonderful <i>secrets in nature, which if cunningly
used and applied to fit things and times, must needs amaze
vulgar heads</i>; and though some of these are known to philosophers
and scholars, yet are there many secret things locked from the wisest
men, whose powers and natures because they know not, they may also
be deluded by them. Augustine<a id="FNanchor_122_122" href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> reckons up many instances, as the
loadstone, the stone pyrites, selenites, the fountain of Epirus, that can
kindle a torch, and many more; and determines that many strange
things are done by the application of these natural powers, either by
the wit of man or diabolical art. To this purpose he gives an account
of an unextinguishable lamp, Λύχνος ἄσβεστος, in a temple of Venus,
which allured men to worship there, as to an unquestionable deity,
when in truth the thing was but an ingenious composition from the
stone asbeston, of which Pliny makes mention, that being kindled, it
will not be quenched with water.<a id="FNanchor_123_123" href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Of this nature were those lamps
found in several vaults accompanying the ashes of the dead, reserved
there in urns, both in England and elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_124_124" href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> If men by such helps
find such easy ways to delude men, what exactness of workmanship
and seeming wonders may be expected from Satan upon such advantages!</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Many of his wonders may challenge <i>a higher rise</i>.
Satan knows the secret ways of nature’s operations, and the ways of
accelerating or retarding those works; so that he cannot only do what
nature can do, by a due application of active to passive principles,<a id="FNanchor_125_125" href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
and the help of those seminal powers that are in things, but he may
be supposed to perform them in a quicker and more expeditious man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>ner.
Thus worms, flies, and serpents, that are bred of putrefaction,
Satan may speedily produce; and who can tell how far this help may
reach in his works of wonders?</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, <i>The secret way of Satan’s movings and actings is no
small matter in these affairs</i>. How many things do common jugglers
by the swift motions of their hands, that seem incredible! Thus they
make the bystanders believe they change the substances, natures, and
forms of things, when they only, by a speedy conveyance, take these
things away, and put others in their room. They that shall consider
Satan as a spirit, subtle, imperceptible, quick of motion, &amp;c., will
easily believe him to be more accomplished for such conveyances than
all the men in the world.</p>

<p>Having now seen the way of his wonders, let us next consider the
advantage he hath by such actions. If we look upon Simon Magus,
Acts viii. 10, 11, we find that he by these ways had a general influence
upon the people, ‘To him they all gave heed, from the least to
the greatest;’ and that his actions were reckoned no less than miraculous,
as done by ‘the mighty power of God.’ If we go from hence to
the magicians of Pharaoh, Exod. vii. 11, it is said, ‘They did so with
their enchantments,’ which, howsoever the matter was, prevailed so
with Pharaoh and the court, that they saw no difference betwixt the
wonders done by Moses and them, save that, it may be, they thought
Moses the more skilful magician. But besides this, if we consider
what they did, it will argue much for his power, if we can imagine, as
some do,<a id="FNanchor_126_126" href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> that they turned their rods into real serpents; the power is
evident: and there is this that favours that opinion; it is said they
could not make lice, which seems to imply they really did the other
things, and it had been as easy to delude the senses in the matter of
lice as in the rods, if it had been no more than a delusion. Neither
are some awanting to give a reason of such a power—viz., serpents,
lice, &amp;c., being the offspring of putrefaction; by his dexterous application
of the seminal principles of things, he might quickly produce
them. If we go lower, and take up with the opinion of those that
think that they were neither mere delusions, nor yet true serpents; but
real bodies like serpents, though without life, this will argue a very
great power.<a id="FNanchor_127_127" href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Or if we suppose, as some do,<a id="FNanchor_128_128" href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> that Satan took away the
rods, and secretly conveyed serpents in their stead, or—which is the
lowest apprehension we can have—that Pharaoh’s sight was deceived,
the matter is still far from being contemptible, forasmuch as we see
the spectators were not able to discern the cheat.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, The next instance produceable for evidencing his power
is that <i>of apparitions</i>. It cannot be denied but that the fancy of
melancholic or timorous persons is fruitful enough to create a thousand
bugbears; and also that the villainy of some persons hath been
designedly employed to deceive people with mock apparitions—of which
abundance of instances might be given from the knavery of the papists,
discovered to the world beyond contradiction; but all this will not
conclude that there are no real appearances of spirit or devils. Such
sad effects in all ages there have been of these things, that most men
will take it for an undeniable truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>Instead of others, let the apparition at Endor to Saul come to examination.
Some indeed<a id="FNanchor_129_129" href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> will have us believe that all that was but a
subtle cheat managed by that old woman; and that neither Samuel
nor the devil did appear, but that the woman, in another room by
herself, or with a confederate, gave the answer to Saul. But whosoever
shall read that story, and shall consider Saul’s bowing and discourse,
and the answers given, must acknowledge that Saul thought
at least he saw and spake with Samuel; and indeed the whole transaction
is such, that such a cheat cannot be supposed.</p>

<p>Satisfying ourselves, then, that there was an apparition, we must
next inquire whether it was true Samuel or Satan. It cannot be
denied but that many judge it was true Samuel, but their reasons are
weak.<a id="FNanchor_130_130" href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>[1.] That proof from Ecclesiasticus xlvi. 23, is not canonical with us.</p>

<p>[2.] That he was called Samuel, is of no force. Scripture often
gives names of things according to their appearances.</p>

<p>[3.] That things future were foretold, was but from conjecture; in
which Satan yet, all things considered, had good ground for his
guessing.</p>

<p>[4.] That the name Jehovah is oft repeated, signifies nothing. The
devil is not so scarce of words. ‘Jesus I know,’ saith that spirit in
the Acts.</p>

<p>[5.] That he reproved sin in Saul, is no more than what the devil
doth daily to afflicted consciences in order to despair.</p>

<p>I must go then with those that believe this was Satan in Samuel’s
likeness.</p>

<p>[1.] Because God refused to answer Saul by prophets or Urim;
and it is too harsh to think he would send Samuel from the dead, and
so answer him in an extraordinary way.</p>

<p>[2.] This, if it had been Samuel, would have given too much countenance
to witchcraft, contrary to that check to Ahaziah, 2 Kings i. 3,
‘Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of
Baal-zebub?’</p>

<p>[3.] The prediction of Saul’s death, though true for substance, yet
failed as to the exactness of time, for the battle was not fought the
next day.</p>

<p>[4.] The acknowledgment of the witch’s power, ‘Why hast thou
disquieted me?’ shews it could not be true Samuel, the power of
witchcraft not being able to reach souls at rest with God.</p>

<p>[5.] That expression of ‘gods ascending out of the earth,’ is evidently
suspicious.</p>

<p>The reality of apparitions being thus established, Satan’s power will
be easily evinced from it. To say nothing of the bodies in which
spirits appear, the haunting of places and persons, and the other effects
done by such appearances, speak abundantly for it.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, The last instance is <i>of possessions</i>, the reality of which
can no way be questioned, because the New Testament affords so
much for it. I shall only note some things as concerning this head.
As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, The multitudes of men possessed. Scarce was there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
anything in which Christ had more opportunities to shew his authority
than in casting out of Satan. Such objects of compassion he met with
in every place.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, The multitudes of spirits in one person is a consideration
not to be passed by.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, These persons were often strongly acted, sometime
with fierceness and rage, Mat. viii. 28; some living without clothes
and without house, Luke viii. 27; some by an incredible strength
breaking chains and fetters, Mark v. 3.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, Sometime the possessed were sadly vexed and afflicted,
cast into the fire and water, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, Some were strangely influenced. We read of one,
Acts xvi. 16, that had a spirit of divination, and told many things to
come, which we may suppose frequently came to pass, else she could
have brought ‘no gain to her master by soothsaying.’ Another we
hear of whose possession was with a lunacy, and had fits at certain
times and seasons. The possessed person with whom Mr Rothwell
discoursed, within the memory of some living, could play the critic in
the Hebrew language.<a id="FNanchor_131_131" href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, In some the possession was so strong, and so firmly
seated, that ordinary means and ways could not dispossess them: ‘This
kind comes not out but by prayer and fasting,’ Mat. xvii. 21; which
shews that all possession was not of one kind and manner, nor alike
liable to ejection.</p>

<p>(7.) Seventhly, To all these may be added <i>obsessions</i>: where the
devil afflicts the bodies of men, disquiets them, haunts them, or strikes
in with their melancholy temper, and so annoys by hideous and black
representations. Thus was Saul vexed by ‘an evil spirit from the
Lord,’ which as most conceive was the devil working in his melancholy
humour. That the devil should take possession of the bodies of
men, and thus act, drive, trouble, and distress them, so distort, distend,
and rack their members; so seat himself in their tongues and
minds that a man cannot command his own faculties and powers, but
seems to be rather changed into the nature of a devil than to retain
anything of a man, this shews a power in him to be trembled at.</p>

<p>Satan’s power being thus explained and proved, I shall next speak
something of his cruelty.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s cruelty.—Instances thereof in his dealing with wounded
spirits, in ordinary temptations of the wicked and godly, in persecutions,
cruelties in worship.—His cruel handling of his slaves.</i></p>


<p>He that shall consider his malice and power, must unavoidably conclude
him to be cruel. Malice is always so where it hath the advantage
of a proportionable strength and opportunity for the effecting of
its hateful contrivances. It banisheth all pity and commiseration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
and follows only the dictate of its own rage, with such fierceness, that
it is only limited by wanting power to execute. We may then say of
Satan, that according to his malice and power such is his cruelty.
The truth of this will be abundantly manifested by instances: as,</p>

<p>1. First, <i>From his desperate pursuits of advantage upon those whose
spirits are wounded</i>. The anguish of a distressed conscience is unspeakably
great, insomuch that many are, as Heman, Ps. lxxxviii. 15,
‘even distracted, while they suffer the terrors of the Almighty.’
These, though they look round about them for help, and invite all
that pass by to pity them, ‘because the hand of the Lord hath touched
them,’ [Job xix. 21,] yet Satan laughs at their calamity, and mocks
at them under their fears, and doth all he can to augment the flame.
He suggests dreadful thoughts of an incensed majesty, begets terrible
apprehensions of infinite wrath and damnation, he aggravates all their
sins to make them seem unpardonable. Every action he calls a sin,
and every sin he represents as a wilful forsaking of God, and every
deliberate transgression he tells them is ‘the sin against the Holy
Ghost.’ He baffles them in their prayers and services, and then
accuseth their duties for intolerable profanations of God’s name; and
if they be at last affrighted from them, he then clamours that they
are ‘forsaken of God’ because they have forsaken him. He, as a
right Baal-zebub,<a id="FNanchor_132_132" href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> rakes in their wounds, as flies are ever sucking where
there is a sore. Their outcries and lamentations are such music to
him, that he gives them no rest; and with such triumph doth he tread
upon those that thus lie in the dust, that he makes them sometimes
accuse themselves for that which they never did, and in derision he
insults over them in their greatest perplexities, with this, ‘Where is
now thy God?’ [Ps. xlii. 3,] and ‘Who shall deliver thee out of my
hand?’ This were enough to evidence him altogether void of compassion.
But,</p>

<p>2. Secondly, He shews no less cruelty <i>in his usage of those that are
his slaves</i>. The service that he exacts of those that are his most
willing servants, is no less than the highest cruelty; and not only
[1.] in regard of the misery and destruction which he makes them
work out for themselves, which is far greater than where men are
forced by the most brutish tyrants to buy their own poison or to cut
their own throats, because this is unspeakably less than the endless
miseries of eternal torments; but [2.] also in regard of the very
slavery and drudging toil of the service which he exacts from them.
He is not pleased that they sin, but the vilest iniquities most contrary
to God and most abominable to man, as the highest violations of the
laws of nature and reason, are the things which he will put them
upon, where there are no restraints in his way. He drave the heathens,
as Paul testifies, Rom. i., to affections so vile and loathsome, that in
their way of sinning they seemed to act rather like brutes than men,
their minds becoming so injudicious that they lost all sense of what
was fit and comely. Neither [3.] doth this satisfy his cruelty, that the
worst of abominations be practised, but he urgeth them to the highest
desperateness in the manner of performance, and so draws them out to
the front of the battle, that they might contemn and outdare God to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
his face. He will have them sin with a high hand, and in the highest
bravado of madness to rush into sin as ‘the horse into the battle.’
This cruelty of Satan were yet the less if he only brought them forth
presumptuously in some one or two set battles upon special occasions;
but [4.] he would have this to be their constant work, the task of every
day, upon the same score that Ahithophel advised Absalom to an open
and avouched defilement of his father’s concubines, that so the breach
betwixt them and God might be fixed by a resolute determination,
and consequently that their hands might be strong and their hearts
hardened in rebellion against God. And [5.] that Satan might not
come short of the utmost of what cruelty could do, we may yet further
observe, that though sinners offer themselves willingly enough to conflict
against God in the high places of the field, yet, as not satisfied
with their forwardness, he lasheth and whips them on to their work,
and sometime overdrives them in their own earnestness. Haman was
so hurried and overborne with violent hatred against Mordecai and
the Jews, that his own advancement and the marks of singular favour
from the king availed him not, as to any satisfaction and present contentment,
Esther v. 13. Ahab, though king of Israel, is so vehemently
urged in his desires for Naboth’s vineyard, that he covered his
face and grew sick upon it, [1 Kings xxi. 1, <i>seq.</i>] Thus as galley-slaves
were they chained to their oar, and forced to their work beyond their
own strength.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, There is also a cruelty seen in <i>his incessant provokings
and force upon the children of God</i>, while he urgeth his loathed temptations
upon them against their will. When I consider Paul’s outcry
in this case, Rom. vii. 15, 19, ‘That which I do, I allow not; the
evil which I would not, that do I,’ &amp;c., my thoughts represent him to
me, like those Christians that were tortured in the trough, where
water was poured by a continued stream upon their mouths, till the
cloth that lay upon their lips was forced down their throats; or like
those that had stinking puddle-water by a tunnel poured into their
stomachs, till they were ready to burst; and surely he apprehended
himself to be under very cruel dealing by Satan when he cried out,
‘O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me?’ If we seriously
consider the mind and endeavours of those children of God that are
striving against sin, and have cast it off as the most loathsome abominable
thing, when Satan urgeth them to evil with his incessant importunities,
it is as if they were forced to eat their own excrements, or to
swallow down again their own vomit; for the devil doth but as it
were cram these temptations down their throats against their will.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, If we cast our eye upon <i>the persecutions of all ages</i>,
we shall have thence enough to charge Satan withal in point of
cruelty, for he who is styled ‘a murderer from the beginning,’ [John
viii. 44,] set them all on foot. It is he that hath filled the world with
blood and fury, and hath in all ages, in one place or other, made it a
very shambles and slaughter-house of men. [1.] Can we reckon how
often Satan hath been at this work? That is impossible. His most
public and general attempts of this kind are noted by histories of all
ages. The persecutions of Pharaoh against Israel, and of the prevailing
adversaries of Israel and Judah against both or either of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
are recorded for the most part in Scripture. The persecutions of the
Roman emperors against Christianity are sufficiently known, and what
is yet to come who can tell? A great persecution by Antichrist was
the general belief and expectation of those that lived in Austin’s time,
and long before; but whether this be one more to the ten former persecutions,
that so the parallel betwixt these and Pharaoh’s ruin in
the Red Sea after his ten plagues might run even, be only to be looked
for, or that others are also to be expected, he thinks it would be presumption
and rashness to determine.<a id="FNanchor_133_133" href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> But, however, his particular
assaults of this nature cannot be numbered: how busy is he still at
this work in all times and places! insomuch that ‘He that will live
godly in this world must suffer persecution,’ 2 Tim. iii. 12. But [2.]
If we withal consider what inventions and devices of cruelty and torture
he hath found out, and what endless variety of pains and miseries
he hath prepared, a catalogue whereof would fill a great deal of paper,
we can do no less than wonder at the merciless fury and implacable
rage of him that contrived them. Satan, the great engineer, doth but
give us the picture of his mind in all those instruments of destruction.
And when we see amongst tyrants ways of torturing every member of
the body, and arts of multiplying deaths, that so those that perish by
their hands might not have so much as the mercy of a speedy despatch,
but that they might feel themselves to die, we may reflect it
upon Satan, in Jacob’s words to Simeon and Levi, ‘Cursed be his
anger, for it is fierce; and his wrath, for it is cruel,’ [Gen. xlix. 7.]
[3.] But if we consider what instruments he useth, and against whom,
we shall see cruelty in a higher exaltation. Had he used some of the
beasts of the earth, or some of his apostate associates, to persecute and
afflict the innocent lambs of Christ, it might have been much excused
from the natural instinct or cursed antipathy of such agents; or
had he used only the vilest of the children of men to act his tragical
fury, the matter had been less; but as not content with common revenge,
he persecutes men by men, though all of one blood and offspring,
and so perverts the ends of nature, making those that should
be the comforts and support of men to be the greatest terror and curse
to them—a thing which nature itself abhors, and in regard of which,
that the impressions of pity might be more permanent and efficacious,
God forbade Israel to ‘seethe a kid in the mother’s milk,’ [Exod. xxiii.
19;] nay, he hath prevailed with some of good inclinations and rare
accomplishments—for such were some of the persecuting emperors—to
be his deputies for authorising the rack, for providing fire and faggot,
and, which is strange, hath prevailed so far with them, that they have
been willing to open their ears to the most palpable lies, the grossest
forgeries, the most unreasonable suggestions that known malice could
invent; and then after all, when they were drawn out to butchery and
slaughter by multitudes, they have made such spectacles—which might
make impressions upon an iron breast or an adamant heart—only
advancements of their jollity; and as Nero upon the sight of flaming
Rome took his harp and made melody, so have these tormenting furies
fired, by the help of combustible matter, multitudes of such harmless
creatures, and then taken the opportunity of their light for their night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
sports. And yet, methinks, the devil hath discovered a keener fury
when he hath made them rage against the dead, and dig their graves, and
revenge themselves upon their senseless ashes, and when they could do
no more, seek to please themselves by executing their rage against
their pictures or statues; which actions, though they might be condemned
for follies, yet are they evidences of highest fury, which commonly
destroys the judgment, and sacrificeth wit, reason, and honour
upon the altar of revenge. That the devil should so poison man’s
nature that he should thus rise up against his fellow, that carries the
same specific being with himself, shews enough of his temper against
man, but never more than when he prevails against the engagements
of kindness, blood, affinity, and relation, to raise a man’s enemies out
of his own house, ‘the father against the son, and the son against the
father, the daughter against the mother, and the mother against the
daughter,’ [Mat. x. 35;] for this is little less than an unnatural mutiny
of the members against the body.</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, We have yet a more visible instance of his cruelty in
<i>his bloody and tyrannical superstitions</i>. Look but into the rites and
ways of his worship among the heathen in all ages and places, and
you will find nothing but vile and ridiculous fooleries, or insolent and
despiteful usages. In the former he hath driven men to villainous
debaucheries, in the latter to execrable cruelties. Of the latter I shall
only speak; though in the former, by debasing man to be his laughing-stock,
he is cruel in his scorn and mockery. Here I might mention
his tyrannical ceremonies of the lower order, such as touch not life;
such were their tedious pilgrimages, as in Zeilan; their painful whippings,
as of the youth of Lacedæmon at the altar of Diana; of their
priests, and that with knotted cords upon their shoulders, as at Mexico
and New Spain; their harsh usages in tedious fastings, stinking
drenches, hard lyings upon stones, eating earth, strict forbearances of
wine and commerce, their torturings and manglings of their bodies by
terrible lancings and cuttings for the effusion of blood, 1 Kings xviii.;
their dismembering themselves, plucking out their eyes, mangling
their flesh, to cast in the idol’s face, sacrificing their own blood, as did
the priests of Bellona and Dea Syria.<a id="FNanchor_134_134" href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> So did the kings of New Spain
at their election, as Montezuma the Second, who sacrificed by drawing
blood from his ears and the calves of his legs.<a id="FNanchor_135_135" href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> In Narsinga and Bisnagar
they go their pilgrimages with knives sticking on their arms and
legs till the wounded flesh festered. Some cast themselves under the
wheels of the waggon on which their idol is drawn in procession.<a id="FNanchor_136_136" href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Yet
are all these but small matters in comparison of the bloody outrages
committed upon mankind in the abominable custom of sacrificing men
to him. Of this many authors give us a large account.<a id="FNanchor_137_137" href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> The Lacedæmonians
to avert the plague sacrifice a virgin; the Athenians, by
the advice of Apollo’s oracle, sent yearly to King Minos seven males and
so many females to be sacrificed to appease the wrath of the god for
their killing of Androgeus. The Carthaginians, being vanquished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Agathocles, king of Sicily, sacrificed two hundred noblemen’s children
at once. The Romans had every year such sacrifices of men and women,
of each sex two, for a long time; and this was so common among
the wiser pagan nations, that whensoever they fell into danger, either
of war, sicknesses, or of any other calamity, they presently, to expiate
their offences against their supposed incensed gods, and to clear themselves
of their present miseries or dangers, sacrificed some mean
persons, who for this reason were called καθάρματα, expiations,<a id="FNanchor_138_138" href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
and to this doth the apostle allude in 1 Cor. iv. 13, as Budæus,
Stephanus, Grotius, and many others think; as if he should say,
we are as much despised and loaded with cursings as those that
are sacrificed for public expiation. But what cruel usage may we
expect for the poor barbarous nations of the world, where he had all
possible advantages for the exercise of his bloody tyranny! Many sad
instances of this kind are collected by Purchas in his Pilgrimage, in
his discourses of Virginia, Peru, Brasilia, Mexico, Florida, and other
places, whose stories of this subject are so terrible, and occur so frequently,
that they are almost beyond all belief,<a id="FNanchor_139_139" href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> all which for brevity’s
sake I omit, contenting myself to note one instance or two out of the
Scripture: 2 Kings iii. 27, the king of Moab ‘took his eldest son that
should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering
upon the wall.’ This he did, according to the customs of the Phœnicians
and others, being reduced to great straits, as supposing by this
means, as his last refuge, to turn away the wrath of his God. Of Ahaz
it is recorded, 2 Chron. xxviii. 3, that ‘he burnt his children in the fire,
after the abominations of the heathen.’ That this was not a lustration
or consecration of their children, though that also was used, but a real
sacrificing, is without doubt to Josephus, who expresseth it thus: ‘He
offered his son as an holocaust,’ [ὁλοκάυστωσε.] But whatever Ahaz
did, it is certain the children of Israel did so; ‘They offered their sons
and daughters to devils,’ Ps. cvi. 37. And if the ‘sacrifices of the
dead’ which they ate in the wilderness, mentioned ver. 28, be understood
of the feasts which were made at ‘the burning of their children,’
as some think<a id="FNanchor_140_140" href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>—though many understand it of their senseless dead
gods or their deceased heroes, or for their deceased friends—then this
cruelty had soon possessed them. However, possess them it did, as
appears also by the description of their devouring Moloch, which the
Jewish Rabbins say was a hollow brazen image in the form of a man,
saving that it had the head of a calf, the arms stretched in a posture
of receiving; the image was heated with fire, and the priest put the
child in his arms, where it was burnt to death; in the meantime a
noise was made with drums, that the cries of the child might not be
heard, and hence was it called Tophet, from <i>toph</i>, which signifies a
drum; so that the name and shape of the image shews that it was
used to these execrable cruelties.<a id="FNanchor_141_141" href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>These Scripture evidences, if we were backward to credit what histories
say of this matter, may assure us of the temper and disposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
of Satan, and may enable us to believe what bloody work he hath made
in the world, which I shall briefly sum up in these particulars:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, These inhuman, or rather, as Purchas calls them, over-human
sacrifices, were practised in most nations. Not only the
Indians, Parthians, Mexicans, &amp;c., but Æthiopians, Syrians, Carthaginians,
Grecians, Romans, Germans, French, and Britons used them.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, These cruelties were acted not only upon slaves and
captives, but upon children, whose age and innocency might have
commanded the compassions of their parents for better usage.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, These sacrificings were used upon several occasions,
as at the sprouting of their corn, at the inauguration, coronation, and
deaths of their kings and noblemen, in time of war, dearth, pestilence,
or any danger; in a word, as the priests in Florida and Mexico used
to say, whenever the devil is hungry or thirsty, that is, as oft as he
hath a mind.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, In some places the devil brought them to set times
for those offerings; some were monthly, some annual. The Latins
sacrificed the tenth child; the annual drowning of a boy and a girl in
the lake of Mexico; the casting of two yearly from the <i>Pons Milvius</i><a id="FNanchor_142_142" href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>
at Rome into Tiber, are but petty instances in comparison of the rest.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, We cannot pass by the vast number of men offered up
at one time. So thirsty is Satan of human blood, that from one or
two, he hath raised the number incredibly high. In some sacrifices
five, in some ten, in some a hundred, in some a thousand have been
offered up. It was the argument which Montezuma, the last Emperor
of Mexico, used to Cortez to prove his strength and greatness by, that
he sacrificed yearly twenty thousand men, and some years fifty thousand.
Some have reserved their captives for that end, others have
made war only to furnish themselves with men for such occasions.</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, There are also several circumstances of these diabolical
outrages that may give a further discovery of his cruelty, as that these
miserable creatures thus led to be butchered have been loaden with
all the cursings, revilings, and contumacious reproaches as a necessary
concomitant of their violent deaths. Thus were those used who were
forced to be the public καθάρματα, or expiation, for the removal of
common calamities. Death also was not enough, except it had been
most tormenting in the manner of it, as of those that suffered by the
embracements of Moloch. The joy and feastings of such sacrificings,
which were in themselves spectacles of mourning and sorrow, were
cruelties to the dead, and a barbarous enforcement against the laws
of nature in the living. But the dashing of the smoking heart in the
idol’s face, and the pulling off the skins from the massacred bodies, that
men and women might dance in them, were yet more cruel ceremonies.
And lastly, In those that have been prepared for those solemnities,
by delicious fare, gorgeous ornaments, and the highest reverence or
honours, as was the manner of several countries; yet was this no
other than Satan’s insulting over their miseries, of which we can say
no otherwise, than that his tenderest mercies are cruelties.</p>

<p>[7.] Seventhly, I may cast into the account, that in some places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
Satan, by a strange madness of devotion, hath persuaded some to be
volunteers in suffering these tortures and deaths. Some have cast
themselves under the chariot-wheels of their idols, and so have been
crushed to pieces.<a id="FNanchor_143_143" href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> Some sacrifice themselves to their gods: first they
outcut off several pieces of their flesh, crying every time, ‘For the worship
of my god, I cut this my flesh;’ and at last say, ‘Now do I yield myself
to death in the behalf of my god,’ and so kills himself outright.</p>

<p>[8.] Eighthly, It is wonderful to think that the devil should, by
strange pretexts of reason, have smoothed over these barbarous inhumanities,
so that they have become plausible things in the judgments
of those miserable wretches. In piacular sacrifices they believed that
except the life of a man were given for the life of men, that the gods
could not be pacified.<a id="FNanchor_144_144" href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> In other sacrifices, both eucharistical and for
atonement, they retained this principle, ‘that those things are to be
offered to the gods that are most pleasing and acceptable to us; and
that the offering of a calf or a pigeon was not suitable to such an end.’
This maxim they further improved by the addition of another of the
same kind, ‘that if it were fit to offer a human sacrifice, it must also
be innocent, and consequently little children are the fittest for such a
purpose.’ And some have also conjectured that the devil hath not
been awanting to improve the example of Abraham sacrificing his son,
or the law in Lev. xxvii. 28, or the prophecies concerning the death
of Christ, as the great sacrifice of atonement, to justify and warrant
his hellish cruelty.<a id="FNanchor_145_145" href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> In some cases cruelty hath arisen from the very
principles of reverence and love which children have to parents, and
friends to friends: as in Dragoian, when any are sick, they send to their
oracle to know whether the parties shall live or die; if it be answered
they shall die, then their friends strangle them and eat them; and all
this from a kind of religious respect to their kindred, to preserve, as
they imagine, their flesh from putrefaction, and their souls from torment.<a id="FNanchor_146_146" href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
The like they do at Javamajor, when their friends grow old
and cannot work, only they eat not their own friends, but carry them
to the market and sell them to those that do eat them.<a id="FNanchor_147_147" href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>[9.] Lastly, Let us call to mind how long the devil domineered in
the world at this rate of cruelty. When the world grew to a freer use
of reason and greater exercise of civility, they found out ways of
mitigation, and changed these barbarous rites into more tolerable
sacrifices; as in Laodicea, they substituted a hart to be sacrificed
instead of a virgin; in Cyprus, an ox was put instead of a man; in
Egypt, waxen images instead of men. Images of straw at Rome were
cast into Tiber in the place of living men; and the terrible burnings
of Moloch, which was not peculiar only to the nations near to Canaan,
but was in use also at Carthage, and found in the American islands by
the Spaniards; the like brazen images were also found in Lodovicus
Vives his time, by the French, in an island called by them Carolina.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span><a id="FNanchor_148_148" href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>
These were at last changed into a <i>februation</i>,<a id="FNanchor_149_149" href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> and instead of burning
their children, they only passed them betwixt two fires; but it was
long before it came to this. In the time of Socrates, human sacrifices
were in use at Carthage, and they continued in the Roman provinces
till the time of Tertullian, Eusebius, and Lactantius; though they
had been severely forbidden by Augustus Cæsar, and afterward by
Tiberius, who was forced to crucify some of the priests that dared to
offer such sacrifices, to affright them from those barbarous customs.
In other places of the world, how long such things continued, who can
tell, especially seeing they were found at Carolina not so very long
since?</p>

<p>How impossible is it to cast up the total sum of so many large
items! When these terrible customs have had so general a practice in
most nations, upon so many occasions, upon such seeming plausible
principles; when such great numbers have been destroyed at once, and
these usages have been so long practised in the world, and with such
difficulty restrained, what vast multitudes of men must, we imagine,
have been consumed by Satan’s execrable cruelty!</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, There remains one instance more of the devil’s cruelty,
which is yet different from the former, which I may call his <i>personal
cruelties</i>; because they are acted by his own immediate hand upon
certain of his vassals, without the help or interposure of men, who, in
most of the fore-mentioned cases, have been as instruments acted by
him. Here I might take notice of his fury to those that are possessed.
Some have been as it were racked and tortured in their bodies, and
their limbs and members so distorted, that it hath been not only matter
of pity to the beholders to see them so abused, but also of admiration<a id="FNanchor_150_150" href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>
to consider how such abuses should be consistent with their lives, and
that such rendings and tearings have not quite separated the soul from
the body. In the Gospels we read of some such ‘cast into the fire, and
into the water,’ [Mat. xvii. 15;] others, conversing ‘with tombs and
sepulchres,’ in the cold nights ‘without clothes;’ and all of them
spoken of as creatures sadly tormented, and ‘miserably vexed.’ The
histories of later days tell us of some that vomited crooked pins, pieces
of leather, coals, cloth, and such like; of others snatched out of their
houses, and tired even to fainting, and waste of their spirits, as Domina
Rossa, mentioned by Bodin, with a great many more to this same purpose.
We may take a view of his dealing with witches, who, though
he seem to gratify them in their transportations from place to place,
and in their feastings with music and dancings, are but cruelly handled
by him very often. The very work they are put upon—which is the
destruction of children, men, women, cattle, and the fruits of the earth—is
but a base employment; but the account he takes of them, of the
full performance of their enterprizes, and the cruel beatings they have
of him, when they cannot accomplish any of their revenges, is no less
than a severe cruelty. He gives them no rest unless they be doing
hurt; and when they cannot do it to the persons designed, they are
forced to do the same mischief to their own children or relations, that
they may gratify their tyrannical master. Bodin relates the story of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
a French baron, [p. 180,] who was afterward put to death for witchcraft,
that after he had killed eight children, was at last upon a design
of sacrificing his own child to the devil. And if at any time they
grew weary of so execrable a slavery, or confess their wickedness, they
are so miserably tormented that they choose rather to die than live.
And what else but cruelty can these slaves expect from him, when the
ceremonies of their entrance into that cursed service betokens nothing
else; for their bonds and obligations are usually writ or subscribed with
their own blood; and some magical books have been writ with the
blood of many children; besides, the farewell that they have of him at
their usual meetings, is commonly this thundering threatening, ‘Avenge
yourselves, or you shall die.’ All these particulars are collected from
the confessions of witches by Bodin, Wierus, and others.</p>

<p>But leaving these, let us further inquire into Satan’s carriage toward
those that in America and other dark and barbarous places know no
other god, and give their devoutest worship to him. To those he is
not so kind as might be expected; but his constant way is to terrify
and torment them, insomuch that some know no other reason of their
worship but that he may not hurt them. And since the English
colonies went into these parts, these Americans have learned to make
this distinction between the Englishman’s God and theirs, that theirs
is an evil god, and the other a good God; though that distinction in
other places is in the general far more ancient, where they acknowledge
two gods, one good, the other bad; and the worse the god
is, the saddest, most mournful rites of sacrificing were used, as in
caves, and in the night—the manner of the worship fitly expressing
the nature of the god they served.<a id="FNanchor_151_151" href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> Our countrymen have noted of
the natives of New England, that the devil appeared to them in ugly
shapes, and in hideous places, as in swamps and woods. But these
are only the prologue to the tragedy itself, for they only serve to impress
upon the minds of his worshippers what cruelties and severities
they are to expect from him; and accordingly he often lets them feel
his hand, and makes them know that those dark and dismal <i>preludiums</i>
are not for nothing. For sometimes he appears to the worshippers,
tormenting and afflicting their bodies, tearing the flesh from the
bones, and carrying them away quick<a id="FNanchor_152_152" href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> with him; sometimes six have
been carried away at once, none ever knowing what became of them.<a id="FNanchor_153_153" href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>
By such bloody acts as these he kept the poor Americans in fear and
slavery; so that as bad a master as he is, they durst not but pay their
homage and service to him. All these particulars being put together,
will shew we do the devil no wrong when we call him cruel.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s diligence in several instances.—The question about the
being of spirits and devils handled.—The Sadducees’ opinion discovered.—The
reality of spirits proved.</i></p>


<p>The last particular observed in the text is his <i>diligence</i>. This adds
force and strength to his malice, power, and cruelty, and shews they
are not idle, dead, or inactive principles in him, which, if they could
be so supposed, would render him less hurtful and formidable. This
I shall despatch in a few instances, noting to this purpose,</p>

<p>1. First, <i>His pains he takes in hunting his prey, and pursuing his
designs</i>. It is nothing for him to ‘compass sea and land,’ to labour
to the utmost in his employment; it is all his business to tempt and
destroy, and his whole heart is in it. Hence intermission or cessation
cannot be expected. He faints not by his labour; and his labour, with
the success of it, is all the delight we can suppose him to have. So
that, being pushed and hurried by the hellish satisfactions of deadly
revenge, and having a strength answerable to those violent impulses,
we must suppose him to undergo, with a kind of pleasing willingness,
all imaginable toil and labour. If we look into ourselves, we find it
true, to our no small trouble and hazard. Doth he at any time easily
desist when we give him a repulse? Doth he not come again and
again, with often and impudently-repeated importunities? Doth he
not carry a design in his mind for months and years against us? And
when the motion is not feasible, yet he forgets it not, but after a long
interruption begins again where he left; which shews that he is big
with his projects, and his mind hath no rest. He stretcheth out his
nets all the day long. We may say of him, that he riseth up early,
and sitteth up late at his work, and is content to labour in the very
fire, so that he might but either disturb a child of God or gain a
proselyte.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, Diligence is not only discovered in laboriousness, but
also in <i>a peculiar readiness to espy and to close in with fit occasions,
which may in probability answer the end we drive at</i>. In this is
Satan admirably diligent; no occasion shall slip, or through inadvertency
escape him. No sooner are opportunities before us, but we may
perceive him suggesting to us, ‘Do this, satisfy that lust, take that
gain, please yourselves with that revenge.’ No sooner obtains he a
commission against a child of God, but presently he is upon his back,
as he dealt with Job; he lost no time, but goes out immediately from
the presence of the Lord and falls upon him. Besides what he doth
upon solemn and extraordinary occasions, these that are common and
ordinary are so carefully improved by him, that everything we hear
or see is ready to become our snare, and Satan will assay to tempt us
by them, though they lie something out of the way of our inclination,
and be not so likely to prevail with us.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, It is also a discovery of his diligence, that he never <i>fails
to pursue every advantage which he gets against us to the utmost</i>. If
the occasion and motion thereupon incline us, so that if we are per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>suaded
by them, he follows it on, and is not satisfied with either a
lower degree of acting sinfully, or with one or two acts; but then he
presseth upon us to sin to the height, with the greater contempt of
God and grievance of his Spirit, the greater scandal and offence to our
brethren; and having once caused us to begin, he would never have us
to make an end. His temptations roll themselves upon us like the
breaking in of waters, which, by the fierceness of their current, make
a large way for more to follow. He knows how to improve his victories,
and will not, through slothfulness or pity, neglect to complete
them. Hence it is that sometimes he reaps a large harvest where he
had sown little, and from one temptation not only wounds the soul of
him that committed it, but endeavours to diffuse the venom and
poisonous steam of it to the infection of others, to the disgrace of
religion, the hardening the hearts of wicked men, and the turning the
ignorant out of the way of truth. In like manner, if he perceive the
spirits of men grow distempered and wounded, he then plies them
with threatenings, fills them with all manner of discouragements,
dresseth every truth with the worst appearance, that it may be apprehended
otherwise than it is, and puts such interpretations on all providences,
that everything may augment the smart of the wound, till
they be overwhelmed with terrors.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, <i>The various ways which he takes</i>, shews also his diligence.
If one plot take not, he is immediately upon another. He
confines not himself to one design nor to one method; but if he find
one temptation doth not relish, he prepares another more suitable. If
covetousness doth not please us, then he urgeth to profuseness; if
terrors do not affright us to despair, then he abuseth mercies to make
us careless and presuming. If we are not content to be openly wicked,
then he endeavours to make us secretly hypocritical or formal. Sometime
he urgeth men to be profane; if that hit not, then to be erroneous.
If he cannot work by one tool, then he takes another; and if
anything in his way disgust, he will not urge it over-hard, but straight
takes another course. Such is his diligence, that we may say of him,
as it was said of Paul upon a better ground, he will ‘become all things
to all men, that he may gain some,’ [1 Cor. ix. 19.]</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, Diligence will most shew itself <i>when things are at the
greatest hazard, or when the hopes of success are ready to bring forth</i>.
In this point of diligence our adversary is not wanting. If men are
upon the point of error or sin, how industriously doth he labour to
bring them wholly over, and to settle them in evil! One would think
at such times he laid aside all other business, and only attended this.
How frequent, incessant, and earnest are his persuasions and arguings
with such! The like diligence he sheweth in obstructing, disturbing,
and discouraging us when we are upon our greatest services or near
our greatest mercies. What part of the day are we more wandering
and vain in our thoughts, if we take not great care, than when we set
about prayer? At other times we find some more ease and freedom
in our imaginations, as if we could better rule or command them; but
then, as if our thoughts were only confusion and disorder, we are not
able to master them, and to keep the door of the heart so close but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
that these troublesome, unwelcome guests will be crowding in, is impossible.
Let us observe it seriously, and we shall find that our
thoughts are not the same, and after the same manner impetuous at
other times as they are when we set about holy things; which ariseth
not only from the quickness of our spiritual sense in our readier observation
of them at that time, but also from the devil’s busy molestation
and special diligence against us on such occasions. Besides, when he foresees
our advantages or mercies, he bestirs himself to prevent or hinder us
of them. If ministers set themselves to study and preach truths that are
more piercing, weighty, or necessary, they may observe more molestations,
interruptions, or discouragements of all sorts, than when they less
concern themselves with the business of the souls of men. He foresees
what sermons are provided, and often doth he upon such foresight
endeavour to turn off those from hearing that have most need and are
most likely to receive benefit by them. Many have noted it, that those
sermons and occasions that have done them most good, when they
came to them, they have been some way or other most dissuaded from
and resolved against before they came; and then when they have
broken through their strongest hindrances, they have found that all
their obstruction was Satan’s diligent foresight to hinder them of such
a blessing as they have, beyond hope, met withal. The like might be
observed of the constant returns of the Lord’s day. If men watch not
against it, they may meet with more than ordinary, either avocations
to prevent and hinder them, or disturbances to annoy and trouble, or
bodily indispositions to incapacitate and unfit them. And it is not to
be contemned, that some have observed themselves more apt to be
drowsy, dull, or sleepy on that day. Others have noted greater bodily
indispositions than ordinarily, than at other times; all which make
no unlikely conjecture of the devil’s special diligence against us on
such occasions.</p>

<p>Let us cast in another instance to these, and that is, of those that
are upon the point of conversion, ready to forsake sin for Christ. Oh,
what pains then doth the devil take to keep them back! He visits
them every moment with one hindrance or other. Sometimes they
are tempted to former pleasures, sometime affrighted with present
fears and future disappointments; sometime discouraged with reproaches,
scorns, and afflictions that may attend their alteration;
otherwhile obstructed by the persuasion or threatening of friends and
old acquaintances; but this they are sure of, that they have never
more temptations, and those more sensibly troubling, than at that
time—a clear evidence that Satan is as diligent as malicious.</p>

<p>I should now go on to display the subtlety of this powerful, malicious,
cruel, and diligent adversary. There is but one thing in the way,
which hitherto I have taken for granted, and that is, Whether indeed
there be any such things as devils and wicked spirits, or that these are
but theological engines contrived by persons that carry a goodwill to
morality and the public peace, to keep men under an awful fear of
such miscarriages as may render them otherwise a shame to themselves
and a trouble to others. It must be acknowledged a transgression of
the rules of method to offer a proof of that now, which, if at all, ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
to have been proved in the beginning of the discourse: and indeed the
question at this length, whether there be a devil, hath such affinity
with that other, though for the matter they are as different as heaven
and hell, whether there be a God, that as it well deserves a confirmation,—for
the use that may be made of it to evidence that there is a
God, because we feel there is a devil,—so would it require a serious
endeavour to perform it substantially. But it would be not only a
needless labour to levy an army against professed atheists, who with
high scorn and derision roundly deny both God and devils—seeing
others have frequently done that—but also it would occasion too large
a digression from our present design. I shall therefore only speak a
few things to those that own a God, and yet deny such a devil as we
have described: and yet not to all of these neither, for there were many
heathens who were confident assertors of a deity, that nevertheless
denied the being of spirits as severed from corporeity; and others were
so far from the acknowledgment of devils, that they confounded them
in the number of their gods. Others there were who gave such credit
to the frequent relations of apparitions and disturbances of that kind,
that many had attested and complained of, that they expressed more
ingenuity<a id="FNanchor_154_154" href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> than Lucian, who pertinaciously refused to believe, because
he never saw them; and yet though they believed something of reality
in that that was the affrightment and trouble of others, they nevertheless
ascribed such extraordinary things to natural causes, some to the
powers of the heavens and stars in their influences upon natural bodies,
or by the mediation of certain herbs, stones, minerals, creatures, voices,
and characters, under a special observation of the motion of the
planets.<a id="FNanchor_155_155" href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Some refer such things to the subtlety and quickness of the
senses of hearing and seeing, which might create forms and images of
things, or discover I know not what reflections from the sun and
moon. Some [Pomponatius, Epicureans] fancy the shapes and visions
to be exuviæ, thin scales or skins of natural things, giving representations
of the bodies that cast them off, or exhalations from sepulchres,
representing the shape of the body. Others [Cardan, Academics]
make them the effects of our untrusty and deceitful senses, the debility
and corruption whereof they conclude to be such, and so general, that
most men are in hazard to be imposed upon by delusive appearances.
But with far greater show of likelihood do some [Averrhoes] make all
such things to be nothing else but the issues of melancholy and corrupt
humours, which makes men believe they hear, see, and suffer
strange things, when there is nothing near them; or really to undergo
strange fits, as in lunacy and epilepsy.<a id="FNanchor_156_156" href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Leaving these men as not
capable of information from Scripture evidence, because disowning it,
let us inquire what mistaken apprehensions there have been in this
matter among those that have pretended a reverence to and belief of
Scripture. The Sadducees deserve the first place, because they are by
name noted in Scripture to have ‘denied the resurrection,’ and to
have ‘affirmed that there is neither angel nor spirit,’ Acts xxiii. 8,
and Mat. xxii. 23.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>This opinion of theirs, could we certainly find it out, would make
much for the confirmation of the truth in question, seeing, whatever
it was, it is positively condemned in Scripture, and the contrary
asserted to be true. Many, and that upon considerable grounds, do
think that they do not deny absolutely that there were any angels at
all, but that, acknowledging that something there was which was called
an angel, yet they imagining it to be far otherwise than what it is
indeed, were accused justly for denying such a kind of angels as the
Scripture had everywhere asserted and described. For considering
that they owned a God, and, at least, the five books of Moses, if not
all the other books of the Old Testament—as Scaliger and others
judge, not without great probability, for neither doth the Scripture—nor
Josephus mention any such thing of the prophets—it is unimaginable
that they would altogether deny that there was angel or spirit
at all.<a id="FNanchor_157_157" href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> They read of angels appearing to Lot, to Abraham, and met
with it so frequently, that, believing Scriptures to be true, they could
not believe angels to be an absolute fiction; for one fable or falsity in
Scripture, which so highly asserts itself to be an unerring oracle of
the true God, must of necessity have destroyed the credit of all, and
rendered them as justly suspected to be true in nothing, when apparently
false or fabulous in anything.</p>

<p>Again, If we call to mind what apprehensions they had of God,
which all consent they did acknowledge, we might more easily
imagine what apprehensions they had of angels, for in regard that
Moses made mention of God’s face and back-parts, Exod. xxxiii., and
that frequently hands and other parts of man’s body were attributed
to him, they concluded God to be corporeal; and seeing the best of
creatures which God created cannot be supposed to have a more
noble being than was that of their Creator, and, at the utmost, to be
made according to the pattern of his own image and likeness, they
might upon this bottom easily fix a denial of incorporeal spirits, and
by consequence that the soul of man was mortal, and therefore that
there could be no resurrection; so that the nature of angels being
described under the notion of spiritual substances, they are judged to
deny any such thing, supposing that to be incorporeal was as much
as not to be at all; and yet it were unreasonable to deny that they
had not some interpretation for those passages of Scripture that mentioned
angels, which in their apprehensions might be some salvo to
the truth of those historical writings, which they acknowledged; but
what that was we are next to conjecture. And indeed Josephus, by
a little hint of their opinion, seems to tell us that they did not so
much deny the being of the soul, as the permanency of it; and so, by
consequence, they might not so much deny absolutely the existence of
spirits, as their natural being and continuance.<a id="FNanchor_158_158" href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Something there
was that was called by the name of angel—that they could not but
own—and that this must be a real and not an imaginary thing, is
evident from the real effect, and things done by them; yet observing
their appearances to have been upon some special occasion, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
disappearing to have been on a sudden, they might conjecture them
to be created by God for the present service, and then reduced to nothing
when that service was done.</p>

<p>Their opinion, then, of angels seems to be one of these two: either
that they were corporeal substances created upon a special emergency,
but not permanent beings; or that they were but images and impressions
supernaturally formed in the fancy by the special operation
of God, to signify his mind and commands to men, upon which they
might fitly be called God’s messengers and ministers. I put in this
last into the conjecture, because I find it mentioned by Calvin,<a id="FNanchor_159_159" href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> as
the opinion of the Sadducees; but both are noted by Diodate,<a id="FNanchor_160_160" href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> on
Acts xxiii. 8, as with equal probability belonging to them. His
words are, ‘They did not believe they were subsisting and immortal
creatures, but transitory apparitions, or some divine actions and motions
to produce some special and notable effect.’</p>

<p>Others also have been lately hammering out the same apprehension
concerning angels, and profess themselves delivered from it with
great difficulty, differing only in this from some of the heathens
before mentioned, that what those ascribed to the puissance of the
stars, natural powers, or to weakness of senses and corrupt humours,
they, by the advantage of the general notions of Scripture, have
ascribed to God, putting forth his power upon the minds and fancies
of men, or working by the humours of the body.<a id="FNanchor_161_161" href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Upon this foundation
they will easilier make bold with devils, to deny, if not their
being, yet their temptations, imagining that we may possibly do him
wrong in fathering upon him these solicitations and provocations to
sin, which we by experience find to be working and acting upon our
minds, thinking that our own fancies or imaginations may be the
only devils that vex us; and this they more readily hearken to, from
the nature of dreams and visions which happen to men in an ordinary
natural way, where our fancies play with us as if they were distinct
from us; as also from this consideration, that the lunatic, epileptic,
and frenzical persons are in Scripture called demoniacs, as Mat. xvii.
15, with Luke ix., where the person is called lunatic, and yet said to
be taken and vexed by a spirit. So also John x. 20, he hath a devil,
and is mad. But these reasonings can do little with an intelligent,
considering man, to make him deny what he so really feels, and is so
often forewarned of in Scripture; for suppose these were called demoniacs
by the vulgar, it doth not compel us to believe they were so.
Men are apt to ascribe natural diseases to Satan, and Christ did not
concern himself to cure their misapprehensions, while he cured their
diseases.<a id="FNanchor_162_162" href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> This some suggest as a reason that may answer many
cases, though indeed it cannot answer that of Mat. xvii., because,
ver. 18, it is said expressly that ‘Jesus rebuked the devil, and he
departed out of him,’ which would not have been proper to have been
spoken on the account of Christ by the evangelist, to express the cure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of a natural disease, for so would he unavoidably have been rendered
guilty of the same mistake with the vulgar. But if we should grant
that divers mentioned under the name of demoniacs were men disturbed
with melancholy, or the falling-sickness, all were not so; for
those in Mat. viii. 31, ‘besought Christ, after their ejection,’ to have
liberty ‘to go into the herd of swine:’ that if Mr Mede intended
to assert that all demoniacs were no other than madmen and lunatics,
I question not but he was mistaken, and by his reason, not only must
madmen and lunatic persons pass for demoniacs, but all diseases
whatsover; for the blind and dumb were called also demoniacs, Mat.
ix. 32, and xii. 22.<a id="FNanchor_163_163" href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> But the matter seems to be this, that where men
were afflicted with such distempers, Satan took the advantage of them,
and acted the possessed accordingly; as he frequently takes the advantage
of a melancholy indisposition, and works great terrors and
affrightments by it, as in Saul; or at least that, where he possessed,
he counterfeited the fits and furies of those natural distempers,
and acted some like madmen, and others he made dumb and deaf—which
seems to have been the case of those in Mat. ix. and xii.,
where the deafness and dumbness did depend upon the possession,
and was cured with it—others were made to ‘fall on a sudden
into fire or water,’ as those that are epileptic, and therefore might
such be called both lunatic or epileptic, and also possessed with a
devil.</p>

<p>As to that reason which some fetch from dreams, it is rather a
dream than a reason against the being of devils, seeing the effects of
these infernal spirits are far otherwise than the utmost of what can
be imagined to be acted upon the stage of imaginations; so that the
real and permanent being of devils may be easily proved:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>From those real acts noted to be done by angels and
devils</i>. The angels that appeared to Lot were seen and entertained
in the family—seen and observed by the Sodomites. Those that
appeared to Abraham were more than fancied appearances, in that
they ‘ate and drank’ with him. The devil conveyed Christ from
place to place. This could not be a fancy or imagination. Their
begging leave to go ‘into the swine’ shews them real existences.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>From the real effects done by them</i>. We have undoubted
testimonies of men really hurt and tormented by Satan. Of
some really snatched away, and carried a great distance from their
dwellings. Of others possessed, in whom the devil really speaks
audible voices and strange languages, gives notice of things past,
and sometime of things to come. The oracles of the heathen,
which however they were for the most part false or delusory, yet,
in that they were responses from images and idols, were more than
phantasms.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>From what the Scripture speaks everywhere of them</i>.
Of their malice and cruelty; that devils are murderers from the
beginning; their daily waiting how they may devour; their arts,
wiles, and stratagems; their names and appellations, when styled
principalities, powers, spiritual wickednesses, the prince of the power
of the air, and a great many more to that purpose, shew that, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
apparent folly and dotage, we cannot interpret these of motions only
upon the minds and fancies of men. Besides, the Scripture speaks of
the offices of good angels, as their standing continually before the
throne, their beholding the face of God, their accompanying Christ
at his second coming, their gathering the elect from the four winds,
&amp;c., Dan. vii. 10, which cannot be understood of anything else but
real and permanent beings; and this is also an evidence that devils
are, seeing the Scripture mentions their fall and their punishment.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>Seeing also the Scripture condemned the opinion of
the Sadducees, the contrary of that opinion must be true</i>. And expressly
in Acts xii. 9, that which was done by an angel is opposed
to what might be visional or imaginary.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, The reality of devils and their malignity hath been
the opinion of heathens. For there is nothing more common among
them than the belief of inferior deities, which they called δάιμονες or
δαιμόνια, that is, devils; and notwithstanding that they supposed
these to be mediators to the supreme gods, yet they learned to distinguish
them into good and evil.<a id="FNanchor_164_164" href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> The Platonists thought that the
souls of tyrants after death became <i>lemures</i> and <i>larvæ</i>, that is, hurtful
devils; and at last the name <i>devil</i> became of so bad a signification,
that to say, ‘thou hast a devil,’ was reproach and not praise; but
what these groped at in the dark, the Scripture doth fully determine,
using the word <i>devil</i> only for a malignant spirit.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s cunning and craft in the general.—Several demonstrations
proving Satan to be deceitful; and of the reasons why he makes use

<p>We have taken a survey of our adversary’s strength, and this will
open the way to a clearer discovery of his subtlety and craft, which is
his great engine by which he works all his tyranny and cruelty in the
world, to the ruin or prejudice of the souls of men; of which the
apostle in 2 Cor. ii. 11 speaks, as a thing known by the common
experience of all discerning persons. His way is to overreach and

the truth of it: ‘We are not ignorant of his devices.’</p>

<p>This, before I come to the particulars, I shall prove and illustrate
in the general, by the gradual procedure of these few following considerations:—</p>

<p>First, <i>All the malice, power, cruelty, and diligence of which we
have spoken, with all the advantages of multitude, order, and knowledge,
by which these cruel qualifications are heightened—these are but
his furniture and accomplishment which fit him for his subtle contrivances
of delusion, and make him able to deceive; neither hath he
any rise of his power and knowledge but in reference to deceit</i>. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Eph. vi. 11, 12, which is a place wherein the apostle doth of purpose
present Satan in his way of dealing with men, his whole practice is
set forth under the term and notion of arts and wiles: ‘that you may
be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.’ This is the whole
work of Satan, against which the furniture of that spiritual armour
is requisite; and lest any should think that his power or wickedness
are other distinct things in him, which are to be provided against by
other means of help, he presently adds, that these are no otherwise
used by him but in order to his wiles and cunning, and therefore not
to be looked upon as distinct, though indeed to be considered in conjunction
with his subtlety and cunning, as things that make his wiles
the more dangerous and hazardous: ‘For we wrestle not against flesh
and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers
of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
places;’ which words do but strengthen the apostle’s warning and
caution about the forementioned wiles, which are therefore the more
carefully to be observed and watched against, because his power is so
great that he can contrive snares with the greatest skill and art imaginable;
and his wickedness is so great, that we cannot expect either
honesty or modesty should restrain him from making the vilest and
most disingenuous proposals, nor from attesting a conveniency or
goodness in his motions, with the highest confidence of most notorious
lying.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, <i>The subtlety that the Scriptures do attribute to sin, or
to the heart, is mostly and chiefly intended to reflect upon Satan, as the
author and contriver of these deceits</i>. In Heb. iii. 13 there is mention
of the ‘deceitfulness of sin,’ but it is evident that something else
besides sin is intended, to which deceitfulness must be properly ascribed;
for sin being, as most conclude, formally a privation, or if we should
grant it a positive being, as some contend, yet seeing the highest notion
we can arrive at this way, excluding but the figment of Flacius
Illyricus, who seems to make original sin indistinct from the very
essence of the soul, is but to call it an act.<a id="FNanchor_165_165" href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> Deceitfulness cannot be
properly attributed to it, but with reference to him who orders that act
in a way of deceitfulness and delusion; which ultimately will bring it
to Satan’s door. If here the deceitfulness of sin be devolved upon the
subject, then it runs into the same sense with Jer. xvii. 9, ‘The heart
is deceitful above all things.’ But why is the deceitfulness fixed upon
the heart? The ground of that we have in the next words; it is
deceitful, because it is wicked, ‘desperately wicked.’ But who then
inflames and stirs up the heart to this wickedness? Is it not Satan?
Who then is the proper author of deceit but he? It is true, indeed,
that our hearts are proper fountains of sin, and so may be accused
possibly in some cases where Satan cannot be justly blamed; yet if
we consider deceitfulness as a companion of every sin, though our
hearts be to be blamed for the sin, Satan will be found guilty of the
deceitfulness. It may be said a man complies with those things which
are intended for his delusion, and so improperly by his negligence may
fall under blame of self-deception; but it is unimaginable that he can
properly and formally intend to deceive himself. Deceit then, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
being from sin nor ourselves properly, can find out no other parent for
itself than Satan. Besides this, that these texts upon a rational
inquiry do charge Satan with the deceitfulness of sin; they do over
and above point at the known and constant way of Satan, working so
commonly by delusion, that deceitfulness is a close companion of
every sin. The deceitfulness of one sin is as much as the deceitfulness
of every sin. Nay, further, that text of Jer. xvii. 9, shews this
deceitfulness not to be an ordinary sleight, but the greatest of all
deceits above measure, and of an unsearchable depth or mystery;
‘who can know it?’</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, <i>All acts of sin, some way or other, come through Satan’s
fingers</i>. I do not say that all sin is Satan’s proper offspring, for we
have a cursed stock of our own; and it may be said of us, as elsewhere
of Satan, sometime we sin out of our own inclination and disposition;
yet in every sin, whether it arise from us or the world, Satan blows
the sparks and manageth all. As David said to the woman of Tekoah,
‘Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?’ [2 Sam. xiv. 19;]
so may we say, Is not the hand of Satan with thee in every sin thou
committest? This is so eminently true, that the Scripture indifferently
ascribes the sin sometimes to us, sometimes to the devil. It was
Peter’s sin to tempt Christ to decline suffering, yet Christ repelling it
with this rebuke, ‘Get thee behind me, Satan,’ Mat. xvi. 23, doth
plainly accuse both Peter and Satan. It is the personal sin of a man
to be angry, yet in such acts he ‘gives place to the devil;’ both man
and Satan concur in it, Eph. iv. 26. Paul’s ‘thorn in the flesh,’ 2
Cor. xii. 7, whatever sin it was, he calls ‘Satan’s messenger.’ He
that submits not to God, doth in that comply with Satan; as, on the
contrary, he that doth submit himself to God, doth resist the devil,
James iv. 7.</p>

<p>Neither doth that expression of the apostle, James i. 14, ‘Every
man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust,’ &amp;c., give
any contradiction to this. It is not the apostle’s design to exclude
Satan, but to include man as justly culpable, notwithstanding Satan’s
temptations; and that which he asserts is this, that there is sin and a
temptation truly prevalent when there is the least consent of our lust
or desire, and that it is that brings the blame upon us; so that his
purpose is not to excuse Satan, or to deny him to have a hand in
drawing or tempting us on to sin, but to shew that it is our own act
that makes the sin to become ours.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, <i>Such is the constitution of the soul of man, that its
sinning cannot be conceived without some deception or delusion</i>;<a id="FNanchor_166_166" href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> for,
granting that the soul of man is made up of desires, and that the soul
were nothing else but, as it were, one willing or lusting power diversified
by several objects; and that this power or these faculties are
depraved by the fall, and corrupted; and that man in every action
doth consult with his desires; and that they have so great an influence
upon him, that they are the law of the members, and give out their
commands accordingly for obedience; yet still these three things are
firm and unshaken principles:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, That desires cannot be set upon any object but as it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
apprehended truly or apparently good. It is incompatible to a rational
soul to desire evil as evil: <i>Omne appetit bonum</i>.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, The will doth not resolvedly embrace any object till
the light of the understanding hath made out, some way or other, the
goodness or conveniency of the object.<a id="FNanchor_167_167" href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, There is no man that hath not a competent light for
discovery of the goodness or evil of an object presented. Unregenerate
men have, (1.) The light of nature. (2.) Some have an additional
light from Scripture discovery. (3.) Some have yet more from common
convictions, which beget sensible stirrings and awful impressions
upon them. (4.) To those God sometime adds corrections and punishments,
which are of force to make that light burn more clear, and to
stir up care and caution in men for the due entertainment of these
notices that God affords them. Regenerate men have all this light,
and besides that, they have, (1.) The light of their own experience,
of the vileness and odiousness of sin; they know what an evil and
bitter thing it is. (2.) They have a more full discovery of God, which
will make them abhor themselves in dust and ashes, Job xlii. 6; Isa.
vi. 5. (3.) They have the advantage of a new heart, the law of the
spirit of life, making them free from the law of sin and death. (4.)
They have also the help and assistance of the Spirit, in its motions,
suggestions, and teachings. (5.) They fortify themselves with the
strongest resolutions not to give way to sin.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these, it is too true that both regenerate and
unregenerate men do sin; the reason whereof cannot be given from
any other account than what we have asserted—to wit, they are some
way or other deluded or deceived; some curtain is drawn betwixt them
and the light; some fallacy or other is put upon the understanding
some way or other; the will is bribed or biassed; there is treachery in
the case, for it is unimaginable that a man in any act of sin should
offer a plain, open, and direct violence to his own nature and faculties;
so that the whole business is here, evil is presented under the notion
of good; and to make this out, some considerations of pleasure or profit
do bribe the will, and give false light to the understanding. Hence is
it, that in every act of sin, men, by compliance with Satan, are said to
deceive, or to put tricks and fallacies upon themselves.<a id="FNanchor_168_168" href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>5. Fifthly, <i>All kinds of subtlety are in Scripture directly charged
upon Satan, and in the highest degrees</i>. Sometime under the notion
of logical fallacies; those sleights which disputants, in arguing, put
upon their antagonists. Of this import is that expression, 2 Cor. ii.
11, ‘We are not ignorant of his devices,’ where the word in the
original is borrowed from the sophistical reasonings of disputants.<a id="FNanchor_169_169" href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>
Sometime it is expressed in the similitude of political deceits; as the
Scripture gives him the title of a prince, so doth it mark out his
policies in the management of his kingdom, Rev. xii. 7, expressly
calling them deceits, and comparing him to a dragon or serpent for
his subtlety. Sometime he is represented as a warrior: Rev. xii. 17,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
‘The dragon was wroth, and went to make war,’ &amp;c.; and here are his
warlike stratagems pointed at. Mention is made, 2 Tim. ii. 26, of
his snares, and the taking of men alive, or captive, directly alluding to
warlike proceedings, [ἐζωγρήμενοι.] The subtle proceedings of arts
and craft are charged on him and his instruments. Men are said
to be enticed, James i., as fish or fowl, by a bait; others deluded, as
by cheaters in false gaming: Eph. iv. 14, ‘By the sleight of men, and
the cunning craft of those that lie in wait to deceive.’<a id="FNanchor_170_170" href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> The overreaching
of merchants or crafty tradesmen is alluded to in 2 Cor.
ii. 11. All these sleights are in Satan, in their highest perfection and
accomplishment. He can ‘transform himself into an angel of light,’
2 Cor. xi. 14, where he hath an occasion for it; in a word, all
‘deceiveableness of unrighteousness is in him,’ 2 Thes. ii. 10. So
that a general πανουργία, a dexterity and ability for all kind of subtle
contrivances, is ascribed to him, 2 Cor. xi. 3, and that in his very first
essay upon Eve, when the serpent deceived her ‘through subtlety;’
so that whatsoever malice can suggest, or wit and art contrive for
delusion, or whatsoever diligence can practise, or cruelty execute,
all that must be imagined to be in Satan.</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, All this might be further proved <i>by instances</i>. What
temptation can be named wherein Satan hath not acted as a serpent?
Who can imagine the cunning that Satan used with David in the
matter of Uriah? How easily he got him to the roof of the house in
order to the object to be presented to him! How he directs his eye,
wrought upon his passions, suggested the thought, contrived the conveniences!
What art must there be to bring a darkness into David’s
mind, a forgetfulness of God’s law, a fearlessness of his displeasure,
and a neglect of his own danger! Surely it was no small matter that
could blind David’s eye, or besot his heart to so great a wickedness.
But, above all instances, let us take into consideration that of Eve, in
the first transgression, wherein many things may be observed; as (1.)
That he chose the serpent for his instrument, wherein, though we are
ignorant of the depth of his design, yet that he had a design in it
of subtlety, in reference to what he was about to suggest, is plain
from the text, ‘Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast
of the field.’ It had been needless and impertinent to have noted
the serpent’s subtlety as Satan’s agent, if he had not chosen it upon
that score, as advantageous for his purpose. (2.) He set upon the
weaker vessel, the woman; and yet such, as once gained, he knew was
likely enough to prevail with the man, which fell out accordingly.
(3.) Some think he took the advantage of her husband’s absence,
which is probable, if we consider that it is unlikely that Adam should
not interpose in the discourse if he had been present. (4.) He took
the advantage of the object. It appears she was within sight of the
tree, ‘She saw that it was good for food, and pleasant to the eyes;’
thus he made the object plead for him. (5.) He falls not directly
upon what he intended, lest that should have scared her off, but
fetcheth a compass and enters upon the business by an inquiry of the
affair, as if he intended not hurt. (6.) He so inquires of the matter—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
‘Hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?’—as if he
made a question of the reality of the command; and his words were
so ordered that they might cast some doubt hereof into her mind.
(7.) He, under a pretence of asserting God’s liberality, secretly undermines
the threatening, as if he had said, ‘Is it possible that so
bountiful a creator should deny the liberty of eating of any tree? To
what purpose was it made, if it might not be tasted?’ (8.) When
he finds that by these arts he had gained a little ground, and brought
her to some land of questioning of the reality of the threatening,
for she seems to extenuate it in saying, ‘lest we die,’ he grows more
bold to speak out his mind, and plainly to annihilate the threatening,
‘Ye shall not die.’ This he durst not do, till he had gained in
her mind a wavering suspicion, that possibly God was not in good
earnest in that prohibition. (9.) Then he begins to urge the conveniency
and excellency of the fruit, by equivocating upon the name
of the tree, which he tells her could make them knowing as gods.
(10.) He reflects upon God as prohibiting this out of envy and ill-will
to them. (11.) In all this there is not a word of the danger, but
impunity and advantage promised. (12.) This deadly advice he
covers with a pretence of greater kindness and care than God had for
them. See in this, as in a clear glass, Satan’s way of policy; after
this rate he proceeds in all his temptations.</p>

<p>If any inquire why so mighty and potent a prince useth rather the
fox’s skin than the lion’s paw, these reasons may satisfy:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>There is a necessity upon him so to do</i>.<a id="FNanchor_171_171" href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> He must use
his craft, because he cannot compel; he must have God’s leave before
he can overcome; he cannot winnow Peter before he sue out a commission,
nor deceive Ahab till he get a licence; neither can he
prevail against us without our own consent. The Scripture indeed
useth some words that signify a force in tempting, as that he ‘put it
into the heart of Judas,’ ‘filled the heart of Ananias,’ ‘provoked
David,’ ‘rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience,’ and ‘leads
them captive at his will,’ &amp;c.; yet all these and the like expressions
intend no more than this, that he useth forcible importunities, frames
strong delusions, and joins sometime his power to his temptations; as
sometime fowlers shew themselves to the birds they intend to ensnare,
that so they may be affrighted into an awe and amazement, to give a
better opportunity to spread their nets over them.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>If he could compel, yet his way of craft and subtlety
is generally the most prevalent and successful</i>. Force stirs up an
opposition; it usually alarms to caution and avoidance, and frights to
an utter averseness in any design; so that where force should gain its
thousands, subtlety will gain its ten thousands.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>His strength is not useless to him</i>. For besides that
it enables him to deceive with higher advantage than otherwise he
could do, as hath been said, he hath times and occasions to shew his
strength and cruelty, when his cunning hath prevailed so far as to
give him possession. What was said of Pope Boniface, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
entered like a fox, and ruled like a lion, may be applied to him;
he insinuates himself by subtlety as a fox or serpent, and then rules
with rigour as a lion.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s deceits in particular.—What temptation is.—Of tempting
to sin.—His first general rule.—The consideration of our condition.—His

what cases he tempts us to things unsuitable to our inclinations.—His
third rule.—The cautious proposal of the temptation, and the
several ways thereof.—His fourth rule is to entice.—The way
thereof in the general, by bringing a darkness upon the mind through
lust.</i></p>


<p>Our next business is to inquire after these ways of deceit in particular;
in which I shall first speak of such as are of more general and
universal concernment—such are his temptations to sin, his deceits
against duty, his cunning in promoting error, his attempts against the
peace and comfort of the saints, &amp;c.—and then I shall come to some
ways of deceits that relate to cases more special.</p>

<p>As an introduction to the first, I shall speak a word <i>of temptation
in the general</i>. This in its general notion is a trial or experiment
made of a thing. The word that signifies to tempt, comes from a
word that signifies to pierce, or bore through,<a id="FNanchor_172_172" href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> implying such a trial
as goes to the very heart and inwards of a thing. In this sense it is
attributed to God, who is said to have tempted Abraham, and to put
our faith upon trial; and sometime to Satan, who is said to have tempted
Christ, though he could not expect to prevail. But though God and
Satan do make these trials, yet is there a vast difference betwixt
them, and that not only in their intentions—the one designing only a
discovery to men of what is in them, and that for most holy ends; the
other intending ruin and destruction—but also in the way of their
proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_173_173" href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> God by providence presents objects and occasions;
Satan doth not only do that, but further inclineth and positively persuadeth
to evil. Hence is it that temptations are distinguished into
trials merely, and seducements; suitable to that of Tertullian, [De
Orat.] <i>Diabolus tentat, Deus probat</i>, The devil tempts, God only tries.
We speak of temptation as it is from Satan, and so it is described to be
a drawing or moving men to sin under colour of some reason.<a id="FNanchor_174_174" href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> By
which we may observe that, in every such temptation, there is the
object to which the temptation tends, the endeavour of Satan to
incline our hearts and draw on our consent, and the instrument by
which is some pretence of reason; not that a real and solid reason
can be given for sin, but that Satan offers some considerations to us to
prevail with us, which, if they do, we take them to be reasons. This
may a little help us to understand Satan’s method in tempting to sin,
&amp;c., of which I am first to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>In temptations to sin, we may observe, Satan walks by four general
rules:—</p>

<p>1. First, <i>He considers and acquaints himself with the condition of
every man, and for that end he studies man</i>. God’s question concerning
Job, ‘Hast thou considered my servant Job?’ Job i. 8, doth
imply, not only his diligent inquiry into Job’s state—for the original
expresseth it by Satan’s ‘putting his heart upon Job, or laying him to
his heart’<a id="FNanchor_175_175" href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>—but that this is usual with Satan so to do; as if God had
said, It is thy way to pry narrowly into every man: hast thou done
this to Job? Hast thou considered him as thou usest to do? And
indeed Satan owns this as his business and employment in his answer
to God, ‘I come from going to and fro in the earth, from walking up
and down in it.’ This cannot be properly said of him who is a spirit.
Bodies go up and down, but not spirits; so that his meaning is, he
had been at his work of inquiring and searching. And so Broughton
translates it,<a id="FNanchor_176_176" href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> from searching to and fro in the earth; as it is said of
the eyes of God, that they ‘run to and fro,’ which intends his intelligence,
search, and knowledge of things. It is such a going to and
fro as that in Dan. xii. 4, which is plainly there expressed to be for the
increase of knowledge.</p>

<p>The matter of his inquiry or particulars of his study are such as
these: (1.) Man’s state; he considers and guesseth whether a man be
regenerate or unregenerate. (2.) The degree of his state: if unregenerate,
how near or far off he is the kingdom of God; if regenerate,
he takes the compass of his knowledge, of his gifts, of his graces.
(3.) He inquires into his constitution and temper; he observes what
disposition he is of. (4.) His place, calling, and relation; his trade,
employment, enjoyments, riches, or wants. (5.) His sex. (6.) His
age, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The way by which he knows these things is plain and easy. Most
of these things are open to common observation; and what is intricate
or dark, that he beats out, either by comparing us with ourselves, and
considering a long tract of actions and carriage; or by comparing us
with others, whose ways he had formerly noted and observed.</p>

<p>The end of this search is to give him light and instruction in point
of advantage; hence he knows where to raise his batteries, and how
to level his shot against us. This Christ plainly discovers to be the
design of all his study, John xiv. 30, where he tells his disciples he
expected yet another onset from Satan, and that near at hand;
‘for the prince of the world’ was then upon his motion, he was
a-coming; but withal, he tells them of his security against his assaults,
in that there was ‘nothing in Christ’ of advantage in any of these
forementioned ways to foot a temptation upon. It appears, then, that
he looks for such advantages, and that without these he hath little
expectancy of prevailing.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, Satan having acquainted himself with our condition,
makes it his next care to provide <i>suitable temptations, and to strike
in the right vein</i>; for he loves to have his work easy and feasible, he
loves not [to] go against the stream. Thus he considered Judas as a
covetous person, and accordingly provided a temptation of gain for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
him. He did the like with Achan; and hence was it that he had the
Sabeans so ready for the plunder of Job; he had observed them a
people given to rapine and spoil; and accordingly, Job’s goods being
propounded to them as a good and easy booty, he straightway prevailed
with them. It was easy for him to draw Absalom into an open rebellion
against his father; he had taken notice of his ambitious and aspiring
humour, and of the grudges and dissatisfactions under which he
laboured; so that, providing him a fit opportunity, he engaged him
immediately. According to this rule, where he observes men of shallow
heads and low parts, he the more freely imposeth upon them in things
palpably absurd; where he takes notice of a fearful temper, there he
tempts them with terrors and affrightful suggestions. He hath temptations
proper for the sanguine complexion and for the melancholy;
he hath his methods of dealing with the lustful and wanton, with
the passionate and revengeful; he hath novelties at hand for the
itching ear, and suggestions proper for those that are atheistically
inclined.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> To this may be objected, That experience tells us Satan doth
not always walk in this road, nor confine himself to this rule: sometime
he tempts to things which are cross to our tempers and inclinations,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> It is true he doth so; but yet the general rule is not prejudiced
by this exception, especially if we consider,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>That Satan being still under the commands and restraint
of the Almighty, he cannot always tempt what he would, but according
to a superior order and command</i>. Of this nature I suppose was
that temptation of which Paul complained so much; ‘he kept down
his body,’ 1 Cor. ix. 27, upon this very design, that he might have it
in subjection, and yet is he buffeted with a temptation which expected
an advantage usually from the temper and frames of our bodies—for
so much, I suppose, that phrase, ‘a thorn in the flesh,’ will unavoidably
imply—though it still leave us at uncertainties what the temptation
was in particular. Here Satan tempts at a disadvantage, and
contrary to this rule; but then we must know that he was not the
master of his own game—God expressly ordering such a temptation
as was disagreeing with the apostle’s disposition, that it might the less
prevail or hazard him, and yet be more available to keep him low,
‘lest he should be exalted above measure,’ which was God’s design in
the matter.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Sometime our temper alters</i>; as the tempers of our
bodies in a sickness may in a fit be so changed that they may desire
at that time what they could not endure at another. A special occasion
or concurrence of circumstances may alter for the time our constitution,
and so an unusual temptation may at that time agree with
this design.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>Sometime by one temptation Satan intends but to
lay the foundation of another</i>; and then of purpose he begins with a
strange suggestion, either to keep us at the gaze while he covertly
doth something else against us, or to move us to a contrary extreme
by an over-hasty rashness.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>Sometime he tempts when his main design is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
to trouble and disquiet us</i>; and in such cases the most unnatural
temptations, backed with a violent impetuousness, do his work the
best.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, Satan’s next work is <i>the proposal of the temptation</i>.
In the two former he provided materials and laid the trains; in this
he gives fire, by propounding his design; and this also he doth with
caution these several ways:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, He makes <i>the object speak for him, and in many he is
scarce put to any further trouble</i>: the object before them speaks Satan’s
mind, and gains their consent immediately; yet is there no small
cunning used in fitting the object and occasion, and bringing things
about to answer the very nick of time which he takes to be advantageous
for him.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Sometime he appoints <i>a proxy to speak for him</i>;
not that he is shamefaced in temptation, and not always at leisure
for his own work, but this way he insinuates himself the more dangerously
into our affections, and with less suspicion, using our friends,
relations, or intimate acquaintance to intercede for a wicked design.
He did not speak himself to Eve, but chose a serpent: he thought
Eve would sooner prevail upon Adam than the serpent could. He
tempted Job by the tongue of his wife, as if he had hoped that what
so near a relation had counselled would easily be hearkened to. He
tempted Christ to avoid suffering by Peter, under a pretence of highest
love and care, ‘Master, spare thyself,’ [Mat. xvi. 23;] yet our Saviour
forbears not to note Satan’s temptation closely twisted with Peter’s
kindness. At this rate are we often tempted where we little suspect
danger.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, If he finds the two first ways unhopeful or unsuitable,
then he <i>injects the motion, and so plainly speaks to us inwardly himself</i>,
‘Do this act, take this advantage for pleasure or profit,’ &amp;c. He
thought it not enough to tempt Judas by the object of gain, but he
brake his mind in direct terms, and ‘put it into his heart,’ John xiii. 2.
He did the like to Ananias, whose heart he filled with a large motion
for that lie, and backed it with many considerations of the necessity
and expediency of it, Acts v. 3. There is no question to be made of
this. Dr Goodwin gives clear proofs of it, and so do several others.<a id="FNanchor_177_177" href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>
When we consider that thoughts are sometime cast upon the minds
of men which are above their knowledge, and that they say and do
things sometime which are far beyond any of their accomplishments
and parts, and yet in the nature of it wicked, we must be forced to
run so high as to charge it upon Satan. Saul’s prophesying, 1 Sam.
xviii. 10, was by the influence of the evil spirit; and this—as Junius,
Tirinus, and others interpret<a id="FNanchor_178_178" href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>—must of necessity be understood of
such a kind of action and speaking as the true prophets of the Lord
usually expressed under the influences of the blessed Spirit; for from
the likeness of the action in both must the name be borrowed. The
experience that we have of inward disputings, the bandying of arguments
and answers in several cases, is a proof of this beyond exception.
Wounded consciences express an admirable dexterity in breaking all
arguments urged for their peace and establishment; as also in framing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
objections against themselves, so far above the usual measure of common
capacities, that we cannot ascribe it to any other than Satan’s
private aid this way.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, The motion being made, if there be need, he doth
<i>irritate and stir up the mind to the embracement of it</i>; and this he
doth two ways:—</p>

<p><i>First, By an earnestness of solicitation</i>; when he urgeth the thing
over and over, and gives no rest; when he joins with this an importunity
of begging and entreating with the repeated motion; when he
draws together and advantageously doth order a multitude of considerations
to that end; and when in all this he doth hold down the
mind and thoughts, and keep them upon a contemplation of the object,
motions, and reasons. Thus he provoked David, 1 Chron. xxi. 1;
and this kind of dealing occasioned the apostle to name his temptations
and our resistance by the name of ‘wrestlings,’ in which usually
there appears many endeavours and often repeated, to throw down the
antagonist.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, He doth irritate <i>by a secret power and force that he hath
upon our fancies and passions</i>. When men are said to be carried and
led by Satan, it implies, in the judgment of some,<a id="FNanchor_179_179" href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> more than importunity;
and that though he cannot force the spring of the will, yet he
may considerably act upon it by pulling at the weights and plummets—that
is, by moving and acting our imaginations and affections.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, The motion being thus made, notwithstanding all his
importunity, often finds resistance; in which case he comes to the
practice of a fourth rule, which is <i>to draw away and entice the heart
to consent</i>—as it is expressed, James i. 14, ‘Every man is tempted,
when he is drawn away and enticed.’<a id="FNanchor_180_180" href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> I shall avoid here the variety
of the apprehensions which some declare at large about the meaning
of the words, satisfying myself with this, that the apostle points at
those artifices of Satan by which he draws and allures the will of man
to a compliance with his motions, which when he effects in any degree,
then may a man be said to be prevailed upon by the temptation. But
then here is the wonder, how he should so far prevail against that
reason and knowledge which God hath placed in man to fence and
guard him against a thing so absurd and unreasonable as every sin is.
The solution of this knot we have in 2 Cor. iv. 4, ‘The god of this
world blinds the eyes of men,’ draws a curtain over this knowledge, and
raiseth a darkness upon them: which darkness, though we cannot fully
apprehend, yet that it is a very great and strange darkness may be
discovered, (1.) Partly by considering the subject of it—man, a
rational creature, in whom God hath placed a conscience, which is
both a law, and witness, and judge. It cannot be supposed an easy
matter to cloud or obliterate that law, to silence or pervert that witness,
or to corrupt that judge; but it will rise higher in the wonder of
it if we consider this in a godly man, one that sets God before him,
and is wont to have his fear in his heart—such a man as David was,
that in so plain a case, in so high a manner, so long a time, with so
little sense and apprehension of the evil and danger, Satan should so
quickly prevail, it is an astonishment: neither will it be less strange if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
we consider, (2.) The issue and effect of this blindness. Some rise up
against this law of conscience, arguing it false and erroneous, and
making conclusions directly contrary, as Deut. xxix. 19, ‘I shall have
peace, though I walk on in the imaginations of my heart;’ ‘I have
fellowship with him, though I walk in darkness,’ 1 John i. 6; ‘We
will not hearken unto thee, but will certainly do whatsoever thing
goeth out of our own mouth,’ Jer. xlv. 16, 17; in which cases the
συντήρησις, or principles of conscience, are quite overthrown. Some
are hardened, and as to any application of their acts to this rule, quite
dead and senseless. Though they rise not up against the light, yet
are they willingly ignorant, without any consideration of what they
are doing. Here the συνείδησις, or witnessing and excusing power of
conscience, is idle and asleep. Some, though they know the law, and
in some measure see their actions are sinful, yet they pass no judgment,
apprehend no danger: ‘No man smites upon his thigh, saying,
What have I done?’ Jer. viii. 6. Nay, some are so far from this,
that they presumptuously justify themselves, though they see their
own blame and ruin before them: ‘I do well to be angry, and that to
the death,’ saith Jonah, when Satan had spread a darkness upon him.</p>

<p>What shall we say of these things? Here is darkness to be felt,
Egyptian darkness. To explain the way of it fully is impossible for
us; to do it in any tolerable way is difficult. To make some discovery
herein I shall, (1.) Shew that the devil doth entice to sin by ‘stirring
up our lust;’ (2.) That by the power and prevalency of our lust he
brings on the blindness spoken of.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>That Satan enticeth by our lust.—The several ways by which he doth
it.—Of the power and danger of the violence of affections.</i></p>


<p>The way, then, by which he doth entice is by ‘stirring up our lust.’
By ‘lust’ I mean those general desirings of our minds after any unlawful
object which are forbidden in the tenth commandment. Thus
we read of ‘worldly lusts,’ of the ‘lusts of the flesh,’ of ‘lustings to
envy,’ and, in a word, we read of ‘divers lusts,’ the whole attempt and
striving of corrupt nature against the Spirit being set forth by this
expression ‘of lusting against the Spirit,’ Titus ii. 12; 1 Peter ii. 18;
James iv. 5; Titus iii. 3; Gal. v. 17.</p>

<p>That Satan takes advantage of our own lusts, and so ploughs with
our heifer, turning our own weapons against ourselves, is evident by the
general vote of Scripture. The apostle James, chap. i. 14, tells us that
every temptation prevails only by the power and working of our own
lusts. Satan is the tempter, but our lusts are the advantages by
which he draws and enticeth. The corrupt principle within us is
called ‘flesh,’ but the way whereby it works, either in its own proper
motion or as stirred up by the devil, is that of lust and affection; and
therefore he that would stop that issue must look to mortify it in its
affections and lusts, Gal. v. 24. We are further told by John,
1 Epist. ii. 16, that all those snares that are in the world are only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
hazardous and prevailing by our lusts. More generally the apostle
Peter speaks, 2 Peter i. 4; the whole bundle of actual sins that have
ever been in the world came in at this door, ‘The corruption that is
in the world is through lust.’ In the stirring up our lusts Satan useth
no small art and subtlety, and ordinarily he worketh by some of these
following ways:—</p>

<p>1. First, He useth his skill <i>to dress up an object of lust that it may be
taking and alluring</i>. He doth not content himself with a simple proposal
of the object, but doth as it were paint and varnish it, to make
it seem beautiful and lovely. Besides all that wooing and importunity
which he useth to the soul by private and unseen suggestions, he hath
no doubt a care to gather together all possible concurring circumstances,
by which the seeming goodness or conveniency of the object is
much heightened and enlarged. We see those that have skill to work
upon the humours of men place a great part of it in the right circumstantiating
a motion, and in taking the tempers and inclinations of
men at a right time. And they observe that the missing of the right
season is the hazard of the design, even there where the object and
inclination ordinarily are suitable. There is much in placing a picture
in a right position, to give it its proper grace and lustre in the eyes of
the beholders. When a man is out of humour he nauseates his usual
delights, and grows sullen to things of frequent practice. It is likely
Eve was not a stranger to the tree of knowledge before the temptation,
but when the serpent suggests the goodness of the fruit, the fruit itself
seems more beautiful and desirable, ‘good for food, and pleasant to the
eyes,’ [Gen. ii. 9.] Though we are not able to find out the way of
Satan’s beautifying an object that it may affect with more piercing
and powerful delights, yet he that shall consider that not only prudence,
in an advantageous management of things, adds an additional
beauty to objects proposed, but also that art, by placing things in a
right posture, may derive a radiancy and beam of beauty and light
upon them, as an ordinary piece of glass may be so posited to the sunbeams
that it may reflect a sparkling light as if it were a diamond,—he
that shall consider this, I say, will not think it strange for the
devil to use some arts of this kind for the adorning and setting off an
object to the eye of our lusts.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, We have reason to suspect that he may have <i>ways of
deceit and imposture upon our senses</i>. The deceits of the senses are
so much noted, that some philosophers will scarce allow any credit to
be given them; not that they are always deceitful, but that they are
often so, and therefore always suspicious.<a id="FNanchor_181_181" href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> The soul hath no intelligence
but by the senses. It is then a business of easy belief, that
Satan may not altogether slight this advantage, but that when he sees
it fit for his purpose, he may impose upon us by the deception of our
eyes and ears. We little know how oft our senses have disguised
things to us. In a pleasing object, our eyes may be as a magnifying
or multiplying glass. In the first temptation Satan seems to have
wrought both upon the object and also upon the senses; she ‘saw it
was good for food and pleasant.’ Who can question but that she saw
the fruit before? But this was another kind of sight, of more power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
and attraction. An instance of Satan’s cunning in both the forementioned
particulars we have from Austin, relating the story of his
friend Alypius, who by the importunity of his acquaintance consented
to go to the theatre, yet with a resolve not to open his eyes, lest the
sight of these spectacles should entice his heart; but being there, the
noise and sudden shouting of the multitude prevailed so far with him
that he forgot his resolution; takes the liberty to see what occasioned
the shouting, and once seeing, is now so inflamed with delight that
he shouts as the rest do, and becomes a frequenter of the theatre as
others.<a id="FNanchor_182_182" href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> What was there to be seen and heard he knew before by
the relation of others; but now being present, his eyes and ears were
by Satan so heightened in their offices, that those bloody objects
seemed pleasant beyond all that had been reported of them, and the
lust of his heart drawn out by Satan’s cunning disposal of the object
and senses.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, There is no small enticement arising from <i>the fitness
and suitableness of occasion</i>. An occasion exactly fitted is more than
half a temptation. This often makes a thief, an adulterer, &amp;c.,
where the acts of these sins have their rise from a sudden fit of
humour, which occasion puts them in, rather than from design or
premeditation. Cunningly contrived occasions are like the danger of
a precipice. If a man be so foolish as to take up a stand there, a
small push will throw him over, though a far greater might not harm
him if he were upon a level. It is Satan’s cunning to draw a man
within the reach of an occasion. All the resolves of Alypius were not
safeguard to him, when once he was brought within hearing and sight
of the temptation. If he had stayed at home, the hazard of Satan’s
suggestions, though earnest, had not been so much as the hearing of
his ears and sight of his eyes. In 2 Cor. ii. 11, Paul’s fears of Satan’s
taking advantage against the Corinthians, did manifestly arise from
the present posture of their church affairs: for if the excommunicated
person should not be received again into the church, an ordinary push
of temptation might either have renewed or confirmed their contentions,
or precipitated<a id="FNanchor_183_183" href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> them into an opinion of too much severity
against an offending brother; and that their present frame made
them more than ordinarily obnoxious to these snares, is evident from
the apostle’s caution inserted here in this discourse, so abruptly, that
any man may observe the necessity of the matter, and the earnestness
of his affections did lead his pen.<a id="FNanchor_184_184" href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> The souls of men have their general
discrasias and disaffections, as our bodies have, from a lingering
distemperature of the blood and humours; in which case, a small
occasion, like a particular error of diet, &amp;c., in a declining body, will
easily form that inclination into particular acts of sin.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, Satan hath yet a further reach in his enticements, by
<i>the power which he hath upon our fancies and imaginations</i>. That he
hath such a power was discovered before. This being then supposed,
how serviceable it is for his end it is now to be considered. Our
fancy is as a glass, which, with admirable celerity and quickness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
motion, can present before us all kinds of objects; it can in a moment
run from one end of the earth to the other; and besides this, it hath
a power of creating objects, and casting them into what forms and
shapes it pleaseth, all which our understanding cannot avoid the sight
of. Now the power of imagination is acknowledged by all to be very
great, not only as working upon a melancholy and distempered spirit,
of which authors give us large accounts,<a id="FNanchor_185_185" href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> but also upon minds more
remote from such peremptory delusions; as may be daily observed in
the prejudices and prepossessions of men, who by reason of the
impressions of imagination, are not without difficulty drawn over to
the acknowledgment of the truth of things, and the true understanding
of matters; neither is the understanding only liable to a more than
ordinary heat and rapture by it, but the will is also quickened and
sharpened in its desires by this means. Hence is it, as one of the forecited
authors observes,<a id="FNanchor_186_186" href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> that fancy doth often more toward a persuasion
by its insinuations than a cogent argument or rational demonstration.</p>

<p>This is no less a powerful instrument in Satan’s hand, than commonly
and frequently made use of. Who amongst us doth not find and
feel him dealing with us at this weapon? When he propounds an
object to our lust, he doth not usually expose it naked under the
hazard of dying out for want of prosecution, but presently calls in our
fancy to his aid, and there raiseth a theatre, on which he acts before
our minds the sin in all its ways and postures. If he put us upon
revenge, or upon lusts of uncleanness, or covetousness, or ambition,
we are sure, if we prevent it not, to have our imagination presenting
these things to us as in lively pictures and resemblances, by which our
desires may be inflamed and prepared for consent.</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, Sometime he shews his art <i>in preparing and fitting our
bodies to his designs, or in fitting temptations to our bodies and the
inclinations thereof</i>. The soul, though it be a noble being, yet is it
limited by the body, and incommodated by the craziness and indispositions
thereof, so that it can no more act strenuously or evenly to
its principles in a disordered body, than it can rightly manage any
member of it, in its natural motions, where the bones are disjointed.
Hence sickness or other bodily weaknesses do alter the scene, and add
another kind of bias to the soul than what it had before. This Satan
takes notice of, and either follows his advantage of the present indisposition,
or, if he hath some special design, endeavours to cast our
body into such a disorder as may best suit his intention. Asa was
more easily drawn to be overseen in peevishness and rash anger in his
latter days, when his body grew diseased. Satan had his advantage
against Solomon to draw him to idolatry when old age and uxoriousness
had made him more ductile to the solicitations of his wives;
‘When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart,’ 1 Kings
xi. 4. The devil, when he took upon him to foretell Job’s blaspheming
God to his face, yet he attempted not the main design till he thought
he had thoroughly prepared him for it, by the anguish and smart of a
distempered body and mind; and though he failed in the great business
of his boast, yet he left us an experiment in Job, that the likeliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
way to prevail upon the mind in hideous and desperate temptations,
is to mould the body to a suitable frame. He prevailed not against
Job to cause him curse God, yet he prevailed far, ‘he cursed the day
of his birth,’ and spake many things by the force of that distress,
which he professeth himself ashamed of afterwards. The body then
will be in danger, when it is disordered, to give a tincture to every
action, as a distempered palate communicates a bitterness to everything
it takes down.</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, <i>Evil company is a general preparatory to all kinds of
temptation</i>. He enticeth strongly that way. For, (1.) Evil society
doth insensibly dead the heart, and quench the heat of the affections
to the things of God. It hath a kind of bewitching power to eat out
the fear of the Lord in our hearts, and to take off the weight and
power of religious duty. It not only stops our tongues, and retards
them in speaking of good things, but influenceth the very heart, and
poisons it into a kind of deadness and lethargy, so that our thoughts
run low, and we begin to think that severe watchfulness of thoughts
and the guard of our minds to be a needless and melancholy self-imposition.
(2.) Example hath a strange insinuating force to enstamp
a resemblance, and to beget imitation. Joseph, living where his ears
were frequently beaten with oaths, finds it an easy thing, upon a feigned
occasion, to swear by the life of Pharaoh, [Gen. xlii. 15]. Evil company
is sin’s nursery and Satan’s academy, by which he trains up those
whose knowledge and hopeful beginnings had made them shy of his
temptations; and if he can prevail with men to take such companions,
he will with a little labour presently bring them to any iniquity.</p>

<p>7. Seventhly, But his highest project in order to the enticing of
men, is to <i>engage their affections to a height and passionateness</i>. The
Scripture doth distinguish betwixt the ἐπιθυμίας and παθήματα, the
affections and lusts, Gal. v. 24; clearly implying that the way to procure
fixed desires and actual lustings, is to procure those passionate
workings of the mind.</p>

<p>How powerful a part of his design this is, will appear from the
nature of these passions: which are,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>Violent motions of the heart</i>; the very wings and sails of
the soul, and every passion, in its own working, doth express a violence.<a id="FNanchor_187_187" href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>
Choler is an earnest rage; voluptuousness is nothing less; fear is a
desperate hurry of the soul; ‘love strong as death; jealousy cruel as
the grave;’ each of them striving which should excel in violence, so
that it is a question yet undetermined which passion may challenge
the superiority.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Their fury is dangerous and unbridled</i>; like so
many wild horses let loose, hurrying their rider which way they please.
They move not upon the command of reason, but oft prevent it in
their sudden rise; neither do they take reason’s advice for their
course proportionable to the occasion, for often their humour, rather
than the matter of the provocation, gives them spurs; and when they
have evaporated their heat, they cease, not as following the command
of reason, but as weakened by their own violence.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>They are not easily conquered</i>; not only because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
they renew their strength and onset after a defeat, and, like so many
hydra’s heads, spring up as fast as cut off; but they are ourselves—we
can neither run from them, nor from the love of them.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, And consequently <i>highly advantageous in Satan’s
design and enticement when they are driven up to a fury and passionateness</i>;
for besides their inward rage, which the Scripture calls
burning, 1 Cor. vii. 9; Rom. i. 27, by which men are pricked and
goaded on without rest or ease, to ‘make provisions for the flesh,’
and to enjoy or act what their unbridled violence will lead to in the
execution of their desires, they carry all on before them, and
engage the whole man with the highest eagerness ‘to fulfil every
lust,’ Eph. ii. 3, to go up to the highest degrees, and with an unsatiable
greediness to yield themselves ‘servants of iniquity unto iniquity,’
Rom. vi. 19.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>That lust darkens the mind.—Evidences thereof.—The five ways by
which it doth blind men: First, By preventing the exercise of
reason.—The ways of that prevention:</i> (1.) <i>Secrecy in tempting;
Satan’s subtlety therein;</i> (2.) <i>Surprisal;</i> (3.) <i>Gradual entanglements.</i></p>


<p>That Satan doth entice us by stirring up our lust, hath been
discovered; it remains that I next speak to the second thing propounded,
which was,</p>

<p>That by this power of lust he <i>blinds and darkens our mind</i>. That
the lusts of men are the great principle upon which Satan proceeds
in drawing on so great a blindness as we have spoken of, I shall
briefly evince from these few observations:—</p>

<p>1. First, <i>From the unreasonableness and absurdity of some actions
in men otherwise sufficiently rational</i>. He that considers the acts of
Alexander, in murdering Calisthenes, for no other crime than defending
the cause of the gods, and affirming that temples could not be
built to a king without provoking a deity; and yet this so smoothed,
if Quintus Curtius represent him right, that he seemed to flatter
Alexander with an opinion of deification after his death;<a id="FNanchor_188_188" href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> whosoever,
I say, shall consider this cruelty, will condemn Alexander as blind
and irrational in this matter; and yet no other cause can be assigned
hereof, but that his lust after glory and honour darkened his reason.
The like may be said of his killing Hephæstion’s physician, because
<i>he</i> died. The brutal fury of that consul, that made a slave to be
eaten up with lampreys, for no other fault than the breaking of a
glass, can be ascribed to nothing else but the boiling over of his
passion. A sadder instance of this we have in Theodosius senior,
who, for an affront given to some of his officers in Thessalonica, commanded
the destruction of the city, and the slaughter of the citizens
to the number of seven thousand, without any distinction of nocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
and innocent.<a id="FNanchor_189_189" href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> This blind rage the historian notes as the fruit of
violent and unbridled lust in a man otherwise just and gracious.
Thousands of instances of this nature might be added. But,</p>

<p>2. Secondly, If we consider <i>the known and visible hazards to life
and estate, and, that which is more, to that part of them which is
immortal</i>; upon all which men do desperately adventure, upon no
other ground or motive than the gratifications of their lusts,—we
may easily conclude that there is a strange force and power in their
passions to blind and besot them; and this, notwithstanding, is the
common practice of all men, where grace, as the only eye-salve, doth
not restore the sight. The heathens in all these practices of filthiness
and folly, recorded Rom. i. 29, they had so far a discovery of the
danger, if they had not imprisoned that truth and light in unrighteousness,
ver. 18, that they knew the ‘judgment of God, that they which
commit such things are worthy of death,’ ver. 32. Yet, notwithstanding,
the vanity of their imaginations, influenced by lust, darkened
their heart so much that they did ‘not only do these things,’ of so
great vileness and unspeakable hazard, ‘but had pleasure in those
that did them.’</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, The blinding power of lust is yet more remarkable,
<i>when we see men glorying in their shame, and mounting their triumphal
chariots to expose themselves a spectacle to all, in that garb of
deformity which their lusts have put them in</i>. It is a blindness to do
any act against the rules of reason, but it is a far greater blindness
for men to pride themselves in them. What have the issues of most
wars been, but burning of cities, devastations of flourishing kingdoms,
spilling the blood of millions, besides all the famine and other miseries
that follow; yet these actions, that better beseem tigers, lions, and
savage brutes, than men of reason, are honoured with the great,
triumphant names of virtue, manhood, courage, magnanimity, conquest,
&amp;c. If the power and humour of their lusts of vainglory and
revenge had not quite muffled their understandings, these things
would have been called by their proper names of murder, cruelty,
robbery, &amp;c.; and the actors of such tragedies, instead of triumphal
arches and acclamations of praise, would have been buried under
heaps of ignominy and perpetual disgraces, as prodigies of nature,
monsters of men, and haters of mankind.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, But there is yet one evidence more plain and convincing;
<i>when our lusts are up, though reason offer its aids to allay
the storm, yet the wisest of men, otherwise composed and calm, are so
far from taking the advantage of its guidance, that oftentimes they
trample upon it and despise it</i>; and as if lusts, by some secret incantation,
had made them impenetrable, they are not capable of its light
and conduct, and can make no more use of it than a blind man can
do of a candle. To this purpose, let us observe the carriage of disputants.
If men do any way publicly engage themselves in a contest
of this nature, though truth can be but on the one side, yet both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
parties give arguments and answer objections with equal confidence
of victory, and a contempt of the reasons and strength of each other’s
discourses; and this proves so fatal to him that maintains the mistake
or untruth, that not one of a thousand hath the benefit and advantage
for the finding of truth, which free and unprejudiced bystanders may
have; so true is that, <i>Omne perit judicium cum res transit in affectum</i>,
When affections are engaged, judgment is darkened. It is a thing of
common observation, that when men are discoursed into anger and
heat, they presently grow absurd; are disabled for speaking or understanding
reason, and are oft hurried to such inconveniences and
miscarriages, that they are ashamed of themselves; when they cool,
and the fit is over, <i>Impedit ira animum</i>, &amp;c. To all this might be
added the power of lust in persons voluptuous, who dedicate themselves
to the pleasures of the flesh. Those that ‘serve divers lusts
and pleasures,’ their slavish estate, their base drudgery, do clearly
evince that lust unmans them, and puts out their eyes. Mark Antony
by this means became a slave to Cleopatra; never did a poor captive
strive more to obtain the good-will of his lord than he to please this
woman, insomuch that, besotted with his lust, he seemed to want that
common foresight of his danger, which the smallest measure of reason
might have afforded to any, and so dallied himself into his ruin.
From all these considerations and instances, it appears our lusts
afford such vapours and mists that our reason is darkened by them,
or rather they are like a dose of opium, that strongly stupifies and
binds up the senses. But yet it remains that the various ways by
which our lusts do blind us be particularly opened, and they are five.
(1.) Our lusts blind us by preventing the use and exercise of reason.
(2.) By perverting it. (3.) By withdrawing the mind from it. (4.)
By disturbing it in its operation. And (5.) By a desperate precipitancy;
all which I shall more fully explain.</p>

<p>I. First, Our lusts blind us <i>by preventing and intercepting the
exercise of light and reason</i>; and Satan in this case useth these deceits:—</p>

<p>1. First, He endeavours so to <i>stir up our lust as yet to conceal his
design</i>. Secrecy is one of his main engines. He doth not in this case
shew his weapon before he strikes; and indeed his policy herein is
great. For, [1.] By this means he takes us at unawares, secure, and
unprepared for resistance. [2.] We are often ensnared without noise,
and before our consideration of things can come in to rescue us. [3.]
If he get not his whole design upon us this way, yet he oft makes a
half victory. By this means he procures a half content or inclination
to sin, before we discover that we are under a temptation; for
when the foundation of a temptation is laid unespied, then we awaken
with the sin in our hand, as sleeping men awake sometime with the
word in their mouths. If any question, How can these things be?
How can he steal a temptation upon us with such secrecy? I answer,
he can do it these three ways:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, He sometimes after <i>a careless manner, and as it were
by the by, drops in a suggestion into our hearts, and that without
noise or importunity, giving it as it were this charge, ‘Stir not up
nor awaken him;’</i> and then he sits by to observe the issue, and to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
if the tinder will take fire of itself. Thus many a motion thrown into
our hearts, as it were accidentally, ere ever we are aware, begets a
sudden flame.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, He sometimes <i>fetcheth a compass, and makes a thing
far different to be a preamble or introduction to his intended design</i>.
Thus by objects, employments, discourse, or company, that shew not
any direct tendency to evil, doth he insensibly occasion pride, passion,
or lust. How slyly and secretly doth he put us upon what he intends
as a further snare! How unawares, while we think of no such thing,
are we carried sometime upon the borders of sin, and into the enemy’s
quarters! Satan in this acts like a fowler, who useth a stalking-horse,
as if he were upon some other employment, when yet his design
is the destruction of the bird.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Another way of secrecy is his raising <i>a crowd of other
thoughts in the mind, and while these are mixed and confusedly floating
in the understanding or fancy, then doth he thrust in among them
the intended suggestion</i>; and then suffering the rest to vanish, he by
little and little singles this out as a more special object of consideration,
so that we cast a sudden glance upon this, and we are often taken
with it before we consider the danger. In this Satan doth as soldiers,
who take the advantage of a mist to make a nearer approach to their
enemies, and to surprise them before discovery of the danger. This
he doth with us while we are in a musing fit or a melancholy dream.</p>

<p>2. A second deceit for the preventing of a serious consideration
is <i>sudden surprisal</i>. In the former he endeavoured to conceal the
temptation while he is at work with us, but in this he shews the temptation
plainly, only he sets upon us without giving of us warning of
the onset; but then he backs it with all the violent importunity he
can, and by this he hinders the recollecting of ourselves and the aid
of reason. This course Satan only takes with those whose passions
are apt to be very stirring and boisterous, or such as, being his slaves
and vassals, are more subject to his commands. Thus a sudden provocation
to an angry man gives him not time to consider, but carries
him headlong. A surprise of occasion and opportunity is frequently
a conquest to those that have any earnestness of hope, desire, or revenge.
Surely David was taken at this advantage in the matter of
Bathsheba. And here we may note that good men upon such a sudden
motion do yield, without any blow or struggling, to that which at
other times they could not be drawn to by many reasons.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, Consideration is prevented by <i>gradual entanglements</i>.
Satan so orders the matter that sin creeps on upon us as sleep, by insensible
degrees. For this end sometimes he dissembles his strength, and
sets upon us with lower temptations, and with less force than otherwise
he could. He knows we are not moved to extremes, but by steps
and habits; are not confirmed, but by gradual proceedings. To take
too great strides may sometime prevail at present; but the suddenness
and greatness of the alteration begetting a strangeness on the soul, may
occasion after-thoughts and recoiling. Therefore he tempts first to
thoughts, then to a delight in these thoughts, then to the continuation
of them, then to resolve, and so on to practice. And in like manner,
he tempts some to make bold with a small matter, which shall scarce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
come under the notion of wrong; then to a greater, and so gradually
to higher things, and thus he insensibly brings on a thievish inclination
and practice. For the same end sometimes he shews his skill in
the management of occasions; he imperceptibly hooks men into sin by
drawing them first to be bold with occasions; he tells them they may
sit at the ale-house, and yet not be drunk; that they may keep familiarity,
and yet not be lewd; that they may look upon a commodity,
and yet not steal; and when the occasions are by this means made
familiar to them, then he puts them on a step further, but by such
slow motions that the progress is scarce discerned till they be in the
snare.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s perverting our reason.—His second way of blinding.—The
possibility of this, and the manner of accomplishing it directly,
several ways; and indirectly, by the delights of sin, and by sophistical
arguments; with an account of them.</i></p>


<p>II. Secondly, The second way by which Satan blinds us through the
power of lust is by <i>perverting and corrupting our reason, drawing it
to approve of that which it first disapproved</i>. That our lusts have
such a power upon the understanding to make such an alteration, need
not seem strange to those that shall consider that the Scripture, propounding
the knowledge of the highest mysteries, doth positively require,
as a necessary pre-requisite to these things, that we ‘lay aside
all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,’ James i. 20,—in these
terms, noting the loathsome defilement of our lusts,—that so we may
‘receive the engrafted word;’ strongly implying that our lusts have
a power to elude and evade the strongest reasons, and to hinder their
entertainment: which our Saviour notes to have been also the cause
of the Jews’ blindness, ‘How can ye believe, which receive honour one
of another?’ John v. 44. Their lusts of honour stood in their light,
and perverted their reason.</p>

<p>But because this may seem to some almost impossible, that lusts
should turn our sun into darkness, I shall a little explain it.</p>

<p>The understanding doth usually, if practice of sin have not put out
its light, at the first faithfully represent to our mind the nature of good
and evil in matters of temptation and duty; yet its power in this case
is only directive and suasive to the will, not absolutely imperative.
The will must follow the understanding’s dictate, but is not under any
necessity of following its first advice; it is the <i>ultimum dictamen</i>,
the last dictate, that it is engaged to follow. However the will, in the
case last mentioned, be dependent upon the understanding, yet the
understanding doth also, <i>quoad exercitium</i>, depend upon the will, and
as to the act of consideration, is under its command; so that after the
understanding hath faithfully represented the evil of a sin, the will
can command it to another consideration, and force it to new thoughts
and consultations about it; in which case the will doth prompt the
understanding, tells it what verdict it would have it to bring in, and
so doth really solicit and beg for a compliance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>The understanding is ductile and capable of being bribed, and
therefore suffers its right eye to be put out by the will, and as a false
witness or a partial judge gives sentence as the will would have it;
and thus, as one observes,<a id="FNanchor_190_190" href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> the understanding and will are like Simeon
and Levi, brethren in evil, mutually complying with and gratifying
each other.</p>

<p>The possibility of lusts perverting our understanding being discovered,
the way and manner how lust doth thus corrupt it, is needful
to be opened.</p>

<p>Lust exerciseth this power under the management of Satan, directly
and indirectly.</p>

<p>1. First, <i>Our reason is directly perverted when it is so far wrought
upon as to call that good, which is indeed plainly and apparently evil</i>.
So great a corruption is not common and ordinary, neither can the
heart of man be easily drawn to go so palpably against clear light and
evidence. It is therefore only in some cases and in some persons,
either of weaker faculties or of extraordinary debauched principles,
that Satan can work up lust to give so great a darkness. However,
it is evident that Satan useth these deceits in this thing.</p>

<p>(1.) First, He strives, where the matter will bear it, <i>to put the
name of virtue or good upon actions and things that are not so</i>. This
temptation doth most appear in those things that are of a doubtful and
disputable nature, or in those actions which in their appearance or
pretensions may seem to be virtuous. Whatever sin is capable of any
paint or varnish, that he takes the advantage of. Saul’s sacrificing
was a great iniquity, and yet the pretence of the general goodness of
the action, being in itself commanded, and the supposed necessity of
Saul’s doing it, because Samuel came not, were considerations upon
which his understanding warranted to him that undertaking. Paul’s
persecution, though a real gratification of his envious lustings, by his
blinded understanding was judged duty. What more common than
for worldly-mindedness and covetousness to be called a faithful and
dutiful care for the provision of our families! Lukewarmness is
often justified under the notion of moderation and prudence; and
anything that can but pretend any kindred to or resemblance of
good, our lusts presently prevail for an approbation and vindication
of it.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Satan useth <i>the advantage of extremes for the corrupting
of our understandings</i>. To this purpose he doth all he can
to make such an extreme odious and displeasing, that so we may run
upon the contrary as matter of duty. Many there are whose heads
are so weak, that if they see the danger of one extreme, they never
think themselves in safety till they fly to a contrary excess, and then
they think the extreme they embrace needs no other justification than
the apparent evil of what they have avoided. Satan knowing this,
like the lapwing, makes the greatest noise when he is furthest from
his nest, and in much seeming earnestness tempts us to something that
is most cross to our temper or present inclination; or endeavours to
render something so to us, not with any hopes to prevail with us there,
but to make us run as far from it as we can into another snare, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
also to make us believe that we have done well and avoided a temptation,
when indeed we have but exchanged it.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, He directly binds our understandings in sinful practices,
by engaging us <i>to corrupt opinions which lead to wicked or
careless courses</i>. Satan with great ease can put men upon sin, when
once he hath prevailed with them to receive an error which directly
leads to it. Corrupt principles do naturally corrupt practices, and
both these may be observed to meet in those deluded ones whom the
Scripture mentions, ‘that denied the only Lord God, and Jesus Christ,
turning also the grace of God into lasciviousness,’ Jude 4; false
teachers that brought in ‘damnable heresies,’ counted it ‘pleasure to
riot,’ had ‘eyes full of adultery, and could not cease from sin,’ 2 Pet.
ii. 1, 13, 14. With what confidence and security will sin be practised,
when an opinion signs a warrant and pleads a justification for it!</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, In actions whose goodness or badness is principally
discoverable <i>by the ends upon which they are undertaken, it is no great
difficulty for Satan to impose upon men a belief that they act by ends
and respects which do not indeed move them at all</i>; and in this case
men are so blinded that they do not, or will not know or acknowledge
they do evil. The matter of the action being warrantable, and the
end being out of the reach of common discovery, they readily believe
the best of themselves; and looking more at the warrantableness of
the nature of the act in the general than at their grounds and intentions,
they think not that they do evil. This was a fault which Christ
observed in the disciples when they called for ‘fire from heaven upon
the Samaritans,’ Luke ix. 55. The thing itself Elias had done before,
and Christ might have done it then, but they wanted the spirit of
Elias, and therefore Christ rejects their motion as unlawful in them,
who considered not that a spirit of passion and revenge did altogether
influence them; and instead of shewing a just displeasure against the
Samaritans, he shews that Satan had blinded them by their lust, and
that the thing they urged was so far from being good, that it was
apparently evil, in that they were acted by ‘another spirit’ than they
imagined. This way of deceit is very common. How often may we
observe Christians pretending conscientious dissatisfactions about the
actions of others, when the private spring that animates them is some
secret grudge that lies at the bottom; and yet because the thing
wherein they are dissatisfied may truly deserve blame, they are not
apt to condemn themselves, but think they do well.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, <i>Lusts also pervert our reason and knowledge indirectly</i>;
and this is, when we are not so far blinded as to believe the
thing unto which we are tempted, to be good absolutely; yet notwithstanding,
we are persuaded of some considerable goodness in it, and
such as may for the present be embraced. For this purpose Satan
hath ready these two engines:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, He sets before us <i>the pleasures, profits, and other delights
of sin</i>. These he heightens with all his art and skill, that he
may fix in our minds this conclusion, that however it be forbidden,
yet it would conduce much to our satisfaction or advantage if it were
practised; and here he promiseth such golden ends and fruits of sin
as indeed it can never lead unto, inviting us in the words of the har<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>lot,
‘I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
works, with fine linen of Egypt. I have perfumed it with myrrh,
aloes, and cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of these delights,’
Prov. vii. 16. Thus he set upon Eve, ‘Take this fruit, and ye shall
be as gods.’ Thus he attempted Christ himself, ‘All these will I
give thee,’ [Mat. iv. 9,] proffering the kingdoms of the world, and the
glory of them. The pleasures of sin are Satan’s great bait, and these
strongly invite and stir up our lusts; yet because the fear of the danger
may stick in the heart, ‘It is pleasant, but oh I dare not,’ saith
the sinner, ‘I fear the hazard or the evil that may follow:’ therefore
Satan hath his other engine at hand to blind us, and to carry our
minds from such considerations; and that is,</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>His sophistical arguments</i>, by which the danger may
be lessened. Of these his quiver is full: as,</p>

<p>[1.] First, He urgeth that the sin tempted to <i>is little</i>. ‘But a little
one;’ it is not, saith he, so great a matter as you make it; there are
other sins far greater, and these also practised by men that profess as
much as you. Thus he would shame us, as it were, out of our fear,
by calling it severity, niceness, or an unnecessary preciseness. If this
prevail not,</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He hath then another argument: Oh, saith he, be it
so, that it is a little more than ordinary, yet it is but once; taste or
try it; you need not engage yourselves to frequent practice, you may
retreat at pleasure. But if the fear of the danger prevail against this,
then,</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, He labours to put us under <i>a kind of necessity of sinning,
and this he pleads as a justification of the evil</i>. It is not altogether
right, but you cannot well avoid it. This plea of necessity is
large; occasion, example, command of others, strength of inclination,
custom, and what not, are pleaded by him in this case. Some particularly
reckon them up;<a id="FNanchor_191_191" href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> and rather than some men will acknowledge
the evil, they will blame God’s decree, as if they were necessitated by
it, or his providence, as Adam, ‘The woman that thou gavest me, she
gave me of the tree.’ David’s bloody resolve against the house of
Nabal seems to be justified by him, from Nabal’s great ingratitude,
‘In vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness,’ &amp;c.,
1 Sam. xxv. 21; and as one engaged by a necessity of repaying such
wrongs and affronts, doth he determine to cut them off. Aaron, when
he was taxed by Moses about the golden calf, excuseth the matter by
a pretended necessity of doing what he did upon the violent importunity
of such a heady people, Exod. xxxii. 22; and that when
Moses was not to be found, ‘Thou knewest the people, that they are
set on mischief.’ This that he urged to Moses Satan no doubt had
urged to him, and he had acquiesced in it as something that he
thought would excuse, or at least mitigate the offence. Yet if the
sinner break through this snare,</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, He comes on with <i>a softer plea of infirmity</i>, and
endeavours to persuade men that they may yield under pretence of
being forced, and that their strivings and reluctances will lessen the
evil to an apparent sin of infirmity; and thus he bespeaks them, Have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
not God’s children infirmities? They sin, though with reluctancy, and
dost not thou resist?—doth not the fear that is in thy heart shew an
unwillingness? Mayest thou not plead, the evil that I would not do,
that do I? If thou yield, will not God account it a rape upon thine
integrity? If this arrow stick not,</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, Then he <i>extenuates the offence by propounding some
smaller good or convenience that may follow that evil</i>. And this,
though it be a way of arguing directly contrary to that rule, ‘Do not
evil that good may come,’ yet it oft proves too successful; and it is
like that common stratagem of war, when, by the proposal of a small
booty in view, the enemies are drawn out of their hold into a fore-contrived
danger. Thus Satan pleads, This one act of sin may put
you into a capacity of honouring God the more. Some have admitted
advancements and dignities against conscience, upon no better ground
but that they might keep out knaves, and that they might be in a
condition to be helpful to good men. Surely the devil prevailed with
Lot by this weapon, when he offered the prostitution of his daughters
to the lusts of the Sodomites, that the strangers, as he thought them,
might be preserved; by this evil, thinks he, a greater may be avoided.
Herod’s conscience could not at first consent to the cutting off the
head of John Baptist, but when Satan suggests the obligation of his
oath, he concludes that in the killing of John he should escape the
violation of the oath. Thus a pretended good to come becomes a
pander to a present certain iniquity. Now if after all these arguings
the conscience carrieth an apprehension of danger, then,</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, He plainly disputeth <i>the possibility of the escape of
danger, though the sin be committed</i>. All the insinuations of pleasure
and advantage by which Eve was tempted could not at first blot out
her fears of the consequence of that transgression; it did stick in her
mind still, ‘lest we die;’ then Satan plainly denieth the danger she
feared: ‘Ye shall not surely die.’ ‘The threatening,’ saith he, ‘it may
be, was but for trial, or without a strict and positive purpose in God to
execute it; there is no certainty that God was in good earnest when he
spake so.’ The devil usually urgeth the mercy of God, the merits of
Christ, his promises of pardon, the infirmities of the saints, their sins
and repentances, &amp;c.; from all these drawing this conclusion, that
we may venture upon the temptation without any apparent hazard.
It is but repenting, saith he, and that is an easy work to a gracious
soul. God is ready to be reconciled, even to a prodigal son; he is not
so cruel as to cast away any for a small matter; he that waits to be
gracious will not lie at catch for opportunities and occasions to destroy
us; he that delights not in the death of a sinner will not delight to
take strict exceptions against every failing.</p>

<p>If Satan can prevail with us to extenuate the sin, to slight the
hazard, or any way to lessen it upon any of the forementioned accounts;
then having possessed us before with high apprehensions of delights
and satisfactions in the sin, he quickly persuades to accept the motion,
as having a conveniency and advantage in it not to be despised: and
thus doth he indirectly pervert our reason; which is the second way by
which he blinds us through the working of our lust.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s diverting our reason, being the third way of blinding men.—His
policies for diverting our thoughts.—His attempts to that purpose
in a more direct manner; with the degrees of that procedure.—Of
disturbing or distracting our reason, which is Satan’s fourth way
of blinding men.—His deceits therein.—Of precipitancy, Satan’s
fifth way of blinding men.—Several deceits to bring men to that.</i></p>


<p>III. Thirdly, Satan blinds the sons of men by <i>diverting and withdrawing
their reason</i>, and taking it off from the pursuit of its discovery
or apprehensions. For sometime it cannot be induced to go so contrary
to its light as to call evil good, either directly or indirectly. Then is
Satan put to a new piece of policy, and if the frame of the heart and
the matter of the temptation suit his design, he endeavours to turn
the stream of our thoughts either wholly another way, or to still them
by turning them into a dead sea, or by some trick to beguile the
understanding with some new dress of the temptation. So that we
may observe in Satan a threefold policy in a subserviency to this design.
For,</p>

<p>1. First, <i>Satan sometimes ceaseth his pursuit and lets the matter
fall, and thinks it better to change the temptation than to continue a
solicitation at so great a disadvantage</i>. When he tempted Christ and
could not prevail, he ‘departed for a season,’ Luke iv. 13, with a purpose
to return at some fitter time, which Christ himself was in expectation
of, knowing it to be his manner to lie in wait for advantages;
and accordingly when his suffering drew nigh, which, as he speaks to
the Jews, was ‘their hour and power of darkness,’ Luke xxii. 53, he
foretold his return upon him, ‘Now the prince of this world cometh.’
However this attempt of his against the Lord Jesus prevailed not,
yet he shewed his art and skill in the suspending of his temptation to
a more suitable time. And the success of this against us is sadly remarkable,
for however we resist and at present stand out, yet his solicitations
are often like leaven, which while it is hid in our thoughts,
doth not a little ferment and change them, so that at his return he
often finds our lusts prepared to raise greater clouds upon our mind.
Many there are that resist strongly at present that which they easily
slide into when Satan hath given them time to breathe; that say, ‘I
will not,’ and yet ‘do it afterwards,’ [Mat. xxi. 29.]</p>

<p>2. Secondly, He sometimes withdraws their considerations, by <i>huffing
them up with a confidence that they are above the temptation</i>;
as a conquest in a small skirmish, begetting an opinion of victory,
makes way for a total overthrow over a careless and secure army. We
are too apt to triumph over temptations because we give the first onset
with courage and resolution. Christ forewarned Peter of his denial;
he stoutly defies it, and not improving this advertisement to fear and
watchfulness, Satan, who then was upon a design to sift him, took
him at that advantage of security, and by a contemptible instrument
overthrew him. Thus while we grow strong in our apprehensions by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
a denial of a sin, and undervalue it as below us, our confidence makes
us careless, and this lets in our ruin.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, If these ways of policy fail him, he <i>seemingly complies
with us, and is content we judge the matter sinful, but then he proffers
his service to bring us off by distinctions</i>; and here the sophister useth
his skill to further our understanding in framing excuses, coining
evasions, and so doth out-shoot us in our own bow. The Corinthians
had learnt to distinguish betwixt eating of meat in an idol’s temple in
honour to the idol, and as a common feast in civility and respect to
their friends that invited them. This presently withdrew their consideration,
and so quieted them in that course, that the apostle was
forced to discover the fallacy of it. The Israelites cursed him that
gave a wife to any of the tribe of Benjamin; but when they turned to
them in compassion, they satisfied themselves with this poor distinction,
that they would not give them wives, but were willing to suffer
them to take them, Judges xxi. 18, 20. It is a common snare in
matters of promise or oath, where conscience is startled at a direct
violation thereof, by some pitiful salvo or silly evasion to blind the
eyes, and when they dare not break the hedge, to leap over it by the
help of a broken reed.</p>

<p>But I must here further observe, that Satan doth sometimes set
aside these deceits aforementioned, and tries his strength for the withdrawing
of our consideration from the danger of sin in a more plain
and direct manner—that is, by continuing the prospect of the sweets
and pleasures of sin under our eye, and withal urging us by repeated
solicitations to cast the thoughts of the danger behind our back: in
which he so far prevails sometimes, that men are charged with a deep
forgetfulness of God, his law, and of themselves; yet usually it ariseth
to this by degrees. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, When a temptation is before us, and our conscience <i>relucts
it</i>. If there be any inclination to recede from a conviction, the
motion is resisted with a secret regret and sorrow. As the young man
was said to ‘go away sorrowful,’ [Mat. xix. 22,] when Christ propounded
such terms for eternal life as he was not willing to hear of:
so do we; our heart is divided betwixt judgment and affection, and
we begin to wish that it might be lawful to commit such a sin, or that
there were no danger in it; nay, often our wishes contradict our prayers,
and while we desire to be delivered from the temptation, our private
wishes beg a denial to those supplications.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, If we come thus far, we usually proceed to the next
step, which is, to <i>give a dismission to those thoughts that oppose the
sin</i>. We say to them, as Felix to Paul, ‘Go thy way for this time,
and when I have a convenient opportunity I will send for thee,’ [Acts
xxiv. 25.]</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, If a plain dismission serve not to repel these thoughts,
we begin to <i>imprison the truth in unrighteousness</i>, Rom. i. 18; 2 Peter
iii. 5, and by a more peremptory refusal to stifle it and to keep it
under, and become at last willingly ignorant.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, By this means at last the heart grows <i>sottish and
forgetful</i>. The heart is ‘taken away,’ as the prophet speaks, and then
do these thoughts of conviction and warning at present perish together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
This withdrawing of our consideration is Satan’s third way of blinding
us. Follows next,</p>

<p>IV. The fourth way by which our lust prevails in Satan’s hand to
blind knowledge, and that is by <i>distracting and disturbing it in its
work</i>. This piece of subtlety Satan the rather useth, because it is
attended with a double advantage, and, like a two-edged sword, will
cut either way. For (1.) A confusion and distraction in the understanding
will hinder the even and clear apprehensions of things, so
that those principles of knowledge cannot reach so deep nor be so firm
and full in their application. For as the senses, if any way distracted
or hindered, though never so intent, must needs suffer prejudice in
their operations, a thick air or mist not only hinders the sight of the
eye, but also conduceth to a misrepresentation of objects. Thus is the
understanding hindered by confusion. But (2.) If this succeed not,
yet by this he hinders the peace and comfort of God’s children. It
is a trouble to be haunted with evil thoughts. To work this distraction,</p>

<p>1. First, Satan useth a <i>clamorous importunity</i>, and doth so follow
us with suggestions, that what way soever we turn they follow us.
We can think nothing else, or hear nothing else, they are ever
before us.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, He worketh this disturbance in our thoughts by
<i>levying a legion of temptations against us</i>—many at once, and of
several kinds, from within, from without, on every side. He gathers
all, from the Dan to the Beersheba of his empire, to oppress us with a
multitude; so that while our thoughts are divided about many things,
they are less fixed and observant in any particular.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, He sometimes endeavours <i>to weary us out with long
solicitations</i>: as those that besiege a city, when they cannot storm,
endeavour to waste their strength and provisions by a long siege. His
design in this is to come upon us, as Ahithophel counselled Absalom,
when we are ‘weary and weak-handed’ by watching and long resistance.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, But his chief design is <i>to take the advantage of any
trouble, inward or outward</i>, and by the help of this he dangerously
discomposeth and distracts our counsels and resolves. If any have a
spirit distempered, or lie under the apprehensions of wrath, it is easy
for him to confound and amaze such, that they shall scarce know
what they do or what they think. The like advantage he hath from
outward afflictions, and these opportunities he the rather takes, for
these reasons:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, Usually inward or outward troubles leaves some <i>stamp
of murmuring and sullenness upon our hearts</i>, and of themselves distemper
our spirits with a sad inclination to speak ‘in our haste,’ or
to act unadvisedly. Job’s affliction imbittered his spirit, and Satan
misseth not the advantage. Then he comes upon him with temptations,
and prevailed so far that he spake many things in his anguish
of which he was ashamed afterward, and hides his face for it. ‘Once
have I spoken, but I will not answer: yea, twice, but I will proceed
no further,’ Job xl. 5.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, By reason of our burden we are <i>less wieldy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
more unapt to make any resistance</i>. God himself expresseth the condition
of such, under the similitude of those that are ‘great with
young,’ who, because they cannot be driven fast, he ‘gently leads’
them. But Satan knows a small matter will discompose them, and
herein he deals with us, as Simeon and Levi dealt with the Shechemites,
who set upon them when they were sore by circumcision.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>Troubles of themselves occasion confusion, multitudes
of thought, distractions, and inadvertencies</i>. If men see a hazard before
them they are presently at their wits’ end, they are puzzled, they
know not what to do—thoughts are divided, now resolving this, then
presently changing to a contrary purpose. It is seldom but ‘as in a
multitude of words there is much folly,’ Prov. x. 19, so in a distraction
of thoughts there are many miscarriages, and Satan with a little labour
can improve them to more. Here he works unseen; in these troubled
waters he loves to angle, because his baits are not discerned.</p>

<p>V. Fifthly, Our considerations and reasonings against sin are
hindered by <i>a bold forward precipitancy</i>. When men are hasted and
pressed to the committing of sin, and like the ‘deaf adder stop their
ears against the voice of the charmer,’ [Ps. lviii. 4;] in this case, the
rebellious will is like a furious horse, that takes the bridle in his
teeth, and instead of submitting to the government of his rider, he
carries him violently whither he would not. Thus do men rush into
sin, as the horse into the battle. The devices by which Satan doth
forward this, we may observe to be these, among others:—</p>

<p>1. First, He endeavours <i>to affright men into a hopelessness of
prevailing against him</i>, and so intimidates men that they throw down
their weapons, and yield up themselves to the temptation; they conclude
there is no hope by all their resistance to stand it out against
him, and then they are easily persuaded to comply with him. To
help this forward, Satan useth the policy of soldiers, who usually boast
high of their strength and resolutions, that, the hearts and courage of
their adversaries failing, the victory may fall to them without stroke.
The devil expresseth a disdain and scorn of our weak opposition, as
Goliath did of David, ‘Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?
Dost thou think to stand it out against me? It is in vain to buckle on
thine armour, and therefore better were it to save the trouble of striving
than to fight to no purpose.’ With such like arguings as these
are men sometimes prevailed with to throw down their weapons, and
to overrun their reason through fear and hopelessness.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, Sometimes he is more subtle, and <i>by threaping<a id="FNanchor_192_192" href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> men
down, that they have consented already, he puts them upon desperate
adventures of going forward</i>. This is usually where Satan hath used
many solicitations before, after our hearts have been urged strongly
with a temptation. When he sees he cannot win us over to him, then
he triumphs and boasts we are conquered already, and that our
thoughts could not have dwelt so long upon such a subject but that
we had a liking to it, and thence would persuade us to go on and enjoy
the fulness of that delight which we have already stolen privately:
over shoes, over boots. Now though his arguings here be very weak—for
though it be granted that by the stay of the temptation on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
thoughts he hath a little entangled us, it cannot hence be inferred that
it is our wisdom to entangle ourselves further—yet are many overcome
herewith, and give up themselves as already conquered, and so give a
stop to any further consideration.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, When men will not be trepanned into the snare by
the former delusions, he attempts to work them up <i>to a sudden and
hasty resolve of sinning</i>; he prepares all the materials of the sin, puts
everything in order, and then carries us, as he did Christ, into the
mountain, to give us a prospect of their beauty and glory: ‘All these,’
saith he, ‘will I give thee,’ [Mat. iv. 9;] do but consent, and all are
thine. Now albeit there are arguments at hand, and serious considerations
to deter us from practice, yet how are all laid aside by a
quick resolve! Satan urgeth us by violent hurry, as Christ said to
Judas, ‘What thou hast to do, do it quickly,’ [John xiii. 27.] The
soul, persuaded with this, puts on a sudden boldness and resolution,
and when reason doth offer to interpose, it holds fast the door, because
the ‘sound of its master’s feet is behind it,’ [2 Kings vi. 32.] Doth it
not say to itself, ‘Come, we will not consider, let us do it quickly,
before these lively considerations come in to hinder us’? It is loath to
be restrained, and conceiteth that if it can be done before conscience
awaken and make a noise, all is well; as if sin ceased to be sinful
because we by a violent haste endeavoured to prevent the admonition
of conscience. Thus they enjoy their sin, as the Israelites ate their
passover, ‘in haste, and with their staves in their hands,’ [Exod. xii. 11.]</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, <i>When opportunities and occasions will well suit it</i>.
He takes the advantage of a passionate and sullen humour, and by
this means he turns us clearly out of our bias; reason is trampled
under foot, and passion quite overruns it. At this disadvantage the
devil takes Jonah, and hardens him to a strange resolve of quarrelling
God, and justifying himself in that insolency. The humour that Satan
wrought upon was his fretful sullenness, raised up to a great height
by the disappointment of his expectation; and this makes him break
out into a choleric resolution, ‘I do well to be angry,’ [Jonah iv. 9.]
Had he been composed in his spirit, had his mind been calm and
sedate, the devil surely could not by any arguments have drawn him
up to it; but when the spirit is in a rage, a little matter will bind
reason in chains, and push a man upon a desperate carelessness of any
danger that may follow; suitable to that expression of Job, chap xiii.
13, ‘Let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.’</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, All these are but small in comparison of those <i>deliberate
determinations which are to be found with most sinners</i>, who are
therefore said to sin with a high hand, presumptuously, wilfuly,
against conscience, against knowledge; and this ordinarily to be found
only among those whom a custom of sin hath hardened and confirmed
into a boldness of a wicked way and course. When the spirits of men
are thus harnessed and prepared, Satan can, at pleasure almost, form
them into a deliberate resolve to cast the commandment behind their
back, and to refuse to hearken. When any temptation is offered them,
if God say, ‘Ask for the old paths, and walk therein,’ as Jer. vi. 16,
they will readily answer, ‘We will not walk therein.’ If God say,
‘Hearken to the sound of the trumpet,’ they will reply, ‘We will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
hearken.’ When the people by a course of sinning had made themselves
like the wild ass used to the wilderness, then did they peremptorily
set up their will against all the reason and consideration that
could come in to deter them, though they were told the inconveniences,
Jer. ii. 25; that this did unshoe their foot, and afflicted them with
thirst and want, yet was the advice slighted. ‘There is no hope,’ said
they; there is no expectation that we will take any notice of these
pleadings, for we have fixed our resolve, ‘We have loved strangers, and
after them will we go.’ So Jer. xliv. 16, ‘As for the word that thou
hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto
thee, but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth out of our own
mouth.’ A plain and full resolve of will dischargeth all the powers of
reason, and commands it silence. And that this is most ordinary
among men, may appear by these frequent expressions of Scripture,
wherein God lays the blame of all that madness which their lives bring
forth upon their will, ‘Ye would not obey,’ ‘ye will not come to me’;
‘their heart is set to do evil,’ &amp;c. It may indeed seem strange that
Satan should proceed so far with the generality of men, and that they
should do that that should seem so inconsistent with those principles
which they retain, and the light which must result from thence; but
we must remember that these <i>wills</i> and <i>shalls</i> of wicked men are for
the most part God’s interpretation of their acts and carriage, which
speaks as much, though it may be their minds and hearts do not so
formally mould up their thoughts into such open and brazen-faced
assertions. And yet we ought also further to consider, that when the
Spirit of God chargeth man with wilfulness, there is surely more of a
formal wilfulness in the heart of man than lieth open to our view.
And this will be less strange to us when we call to mind,</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, That through the working of Satan <i>the minds of men
are darkened, and the light thereof put out by the prevalency of
atheistical principles</i>.<a id="FNanchor_193_193" href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> Something of atheism is by most divines
concluded to be in every sin, and according to the height of it in its
various degrees, is reason and consideration overturned. There are,
it may be, few that are professed atheists in opinion, and dogmatically
so, but all wicked men are so in practice. Though they profess
God, yet ‘the fool saith in his heart, There is no God,’ [Ps. liii. 1,] and
in ‘their works they deny him,’ [Titus i. 16.] This is a principle that
directly strikes at the root: for if there be no God, no hell or punishment,
who will be scared from taking his delight in sin by any such
consideration? The devil, therefore, strives to instil this poison with
his temptation. When he enticed Eve by secret insinuations, he first
questions the truth of the threatening, and then proceeds to an open
denial of it, ‘ye shall not surely die;’ and it is plain she was induced
to the sin upon a secret disbelief of the danger. She reckons up the
advantages, ‘good for food, pleasant to the eye, to be desired to make
one wise;’ wherein it is evident she believed what Satan had affirmed,
‘that they should be as God,’ and then it was not to be feared that
they should die. This kind of atheism is common. Men may not
disbelieve a Godhead; nay, they may believe there is a God, and yet
question the truth of his threatenings. Those conceits that men have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
of God, whereby they mould and frame him in their fancies, suitable
to their humours—which is a ‘thinking that he is such a one as ourselves,’
Ps. 1.—are streams<a id="FNanchor_194_194" href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> and vapours from this pit, and ‘the hearts
of the sons of men are desperately set within them to do evil,’ upon
these grounds; much more when they arise so high as in some who
say, ‘Doth God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?’ [Ps.
lxxiii. 11.] If men give way to this, what reason can be imagined to
stand before them? All the comminations of Scripture are derided
as so many theological scarecrows, and undervalued as so many pitiful
contrivances to keep men in awe.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s maintaining his possession.—His first engine for that purpose
is his finishing of sin, in its reiteration and aggravation.—His
policies herein.</i></p>


<p>Having explained the five ways by which Satan through the power
of lust causeth blindness of mind in tempting to sin, I shall next lay
open Satan’s devices for the <i>keeping and maintaining his possession</i>,
which are these:—</p>

<p>1. First, He endeavours, after he hath prevailed with any man to
commit an iniquity, <i>to finish sin</i>: James i. 15, ‘After if is conceived
and brought forth, then it is finished;’ which notes its growth and
increase. This compriseth these two things, its reiteration and its
aggravation.</p>

<p>(1.) First, Its <i>reiteration</i> is, when by frequent acts it is strengthened
and confirmed into a habit. There are various steps, by which men
ascend into the seat of the scornful. <i>Nemo repentè turpissimus</i>, It is not
one act that doth denominate men ‘wise to do evil.’ In Ps. i. 1 <i>seq.</i>,
David shews there are gradations and degrees of sin: some walk in
the counsel of the ungodly; some by progress and continuance of sin
‘stand in the way of sinners;’ some, by a hardness of heart and
fixedness in wicked purposes, ‘sit in the seat of the scornful.’ To
this height doth he labour to bring his proselytes; yet he further
designs,</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, That sin may have its utmost accomplishments in
<i>all the aggravations whereof it may be capable</i>. He strives to put
men upon such a course of sinning as may be most scandalous to the
gospel, most ensnaring and offensive to others, most hardening and
desperate to ourselves, most offensive and provoking to God. In this
he imitates the counsel of Ahithophel to Absalom, when he advised
him to go in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel,
that so the breach betwixt him and his father might be widened to
an impossibility of reconciliation. Thus he labours that sinners
should act at such a rate of open defiance against heaven, as if they
resolved to lie down in their iniquity, and were purposed never to
think of returning and making up their peace with God. That sin
may be finished in both these respects, he useth these policies:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>After sin is once committed, he renews his motions and
solicitations to act it again, and then again, and so onward till they
be perfect and habituated to it</i>. In this case he acts over again the
former method by which he first ensnared them, only with such
alterations as the present case doth necessitate him unto. Before, he
urged for the committing of it but once. How little is he to be trusted
in these promises! Now, he urgeth them by the very act they have
already done, Is it not a pleasant or profitable sin, to thy very experience?
hast thou not tasted and seen? hast thou not already consented?
Taste and try again, and yet further; withdraw not thy hand.
A little temptation served before, but a less serves now; for by yielding
to the first temptation our hearts are secretly inclined to the sin,
and we carry a greater affection to it than before; for this is the stain
and defilement of sin, that when once committed it leaves impressions
of delight and love behind, which are still the more augmented by a
further progress and frequent commission, till at last by a strong
power of fascination it bewitches men that they cannot forbear; all
the entreaties of friends, all their own promises, all their resolves and
purposes, though never so strong and serious, except God strike in
to rescue by an omnipotent hand, can no more restrain them than
fetters of straw can hold a giant. God himself owns it as a natural
impossibility, ‘Can the Ethiopian change his skin? no more can ye
do good,’ [Jer. xiii. 23;] and the reason of that impossibility is from
hence, that they are ‘accustomed to do evil.’ Such strong and powerful
inclinations to the same sin again are begot in us by a sin already
committed, that sometime one act of sin fills some men with as
vehement and passionate desires for a further enjoyment, as custom
and continuance doth others. Austin reports that Alypius, when once
he gave way to the temptation of beholding the gladiators, was bewitched
with such a delight, that he not only desired to come again
with others, but also before others. Neither is it any great wonder it
should be so, when, besides the inclinations that are begot in us by
any act of sin to recommit it, sin puts us out of God’s protection,
debilitates and weakens our graces, strengthens Satan’s arm, and
often procures him further power and commission against us.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Satan endeavours <i>to make one sin an engagement to
another, and to force men to draw iniquity with cords of vanity</i>.
Agur notes a concatenation in sins, ‘Lest I steal, and take the name of
God in vain,’ Prov. xxx. 9. Adam sinning in the forbidden fruit,
and proclaimed guilty by his conscience, runs into another sin for the
excuse of the former, ‘the woman that thou gavest me,’ &amp;c. David
affords a sad instance of this, the sin with Bathsheba being committed,
and she with child upon it, David to hide the shame of his offence,
(1.) Hypocritically pretends great kindness to Uriah. (2.) When
that served not, next he makes him drunk, and, it may be, he involved
many others in that sin as accessories. (3.) When this course failed,
his heart conceives a purpose and resolution to murder him. (4.) He
cruelly makes him the messenger of his own destruction. (5.) He
engageth Joab in it. (6.) And the death of many of his soldiers. (7.)
By this puts the whole army upon a hazard. (8.) Excuseth the
bloody contrivance by providence. (9.) In all using still the height<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
of dissimulation. Satan knows how natural it is for men to hide the
shame of their iniquity, and accordingly provides occasions and provocations
to drive them on to a kind of necessity.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>By a perverse representation of the state of godly and
wicked men</i>, he draws on sin to a higher completement. How often
doth he set before us the misery, affliction, contempt, crosses, and sadnesses
of the one, and the jollity, delights, plenty, peace, honours, and
power of the other! It was a temptation that had almost brought
David to an atheistical resolve against all religious duty, and that
which he observed had prevailed altogether with many professors, Ps.
lxxiii. When they observed ‘they were not in trouble like other
men,’ and that their mouth and tongue had been insolent against God,
without any rebuke or check from him; when in the meantime the
godly were ‘plagued all the day, and chastened every morning:’ some
that were, in profession or estimation at least, God’s people, returned
to take up these thoughts, and to resolve upon such practices, ver. 10;
as if God, who sees all these with so much silence, must be supposed
knowingly to give some countenance to such actions. This, indeed,
when it is prosecuted upon our hearts in its full strength with those
ugly surmises, jealousies, and misapprehensions that are wont to
accompany it, is a sad step to a desperate neglect of duty and a carelessness
in sinning, in that it insensibly introduceth atheistical impressions
upon the hearts of men, and such are apt to catch hold even
upon good men, who are but too ready to say as David, ‘I have
cleansed my hands in vain,’ [ver. 13.]</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Satan hath yet another piece of policy for the multiplication
and aggravation of sin, which is <i>the enmity and opposition of
the law</i>. Of this the apostle Paul sadly complains from his own experience:
Rom. vii. 8, ‘Sin taking occasion by the commandment,
wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.’ What he laments is
this, that such is the perverseness of our natures, that the law, instead
of restraining us, doth the more enrage us, so that accidentally the law
doth multiply sin; for when the restraint of the law is before us, lust
burns not only more inwardly, but when it cannot be kept in and
smothered, then it breaks out with greater violence, ‘Let us break
their bonds asunder,’ &amp;c., [Ps. ii. 3.] When the law condemns our
lusts, they grow surly and desperate: ‘Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow
we die,’ &amp;c., [Isa. xxii. 13.] If any wonder that the law,
which was given of purpose to repress sin, and which is of so great use
in its authority to kill it in us, and to hinder temptations, should thus
be used by Satan to increase and enrage it, they may consider that it
is but still an accidental occasion, and not a cause, and sin takes this
occasion without any fault of the law. Satan to this end watcheth
the time<a id="FNanchor_195_195" href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> when our hearts are most earnestly set upon our lusts, when
our desires are most highly engaged, and then by a subtle art so
opposeth the law, letting in its contradictions in way and measure
suitable, that our hearts conceive a grudge at restraint, which together
with its earnestness to satisfy the flesh, ariseth up to a furious madness,
and violent striving to maintain a liberty and freedom to do
according to the desires of their heart; whereas this same law, if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
be applied to the heart when it is more cooled and not so highly engaged
upon a design of lust, will break, terrify, and restrain the heart,
and put such a damp upon temptations that they shall not be able to
stand before it. So great a difference is there in the various seasons
of the application of this law; in which art for the enflaming of the
heart to iniquity, Satan shews a wonderful dexterity.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s keeping all in quiet, which is his second engine for keeping
his possession, and for that purpose his keeping us from going to the
light by several subtleties; also of making us rise up against the
light, and by what ways he doth that.</i></p>


<p>Satan’s next engine for the maintaining his possession, is to <i>keep all
in quiet</i>; which our Saviour notes: Luke xi. 21, ‘When a strong
man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace.’ He urgeth
this against those that objected to him, that he cast out devils by
Beelzebub, which calumny he confuteth, by shewing the inconsistency
of that with Satan’s principles and design—it being a thing sufficiently
known and universally practised, that no man will disturb or dispute
against his own peaceable possession; neither can it be supposed Satan
will do it, because he acts by this common rule of keeping down and
hindering anything that may disquiet. Breach of peace is hazardous
to a possession. An uneasy government occasions mutinies and revolts
of subjects; yet we might think that, the wages of sin, the light and
power of conscience considered, it were no easy task for the devil to
rule his slaves with so much quiet as it is observed he doth. His
skill in this particular, and the way of managing his interest for such
an end, we may clearly see in John iii. 20, ‘Every one that doth evil,
hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be
reproved.’ From which place we may observe—(1.) The great thing
that doth disquiet Satan’s possession is light. (2.) The reason of that
disquietment is the discovery that light makes, and the shame that
follows that discovery. (3.) The way to prevent that light, and the
reproof of it, is to avoid coming to it; and where it cannot be avoided,
to hate it. It is Satan’s business then for keeping all in peace—(1.)
To keep us from the light; or if that cannot be, then (2.) To make us
rise up against it. I shall make inquiry after both these projects of
the devil.</p>

<p>To keep us from coming to the light, he useth a great many
subtleties. As,</p>

<p>1. First, <i>For his own part he forbears to do anything that might
discompose or affright entangled souls</i>. At other times, and in other
cases, he loves to torment and affright them, to cause their wounds to
stink and corrupt; but in this case he takes a contrary course, he
keeps off, as much as may be, all reflections of conscience; he conceals
the evil and danger of sin, he sings them asleep in their folly, ‘till a
dart strike through their liver,’ and hastens them to the snare, ‘as a
bird that knoweth not that it is for his life,’ Prov. vii. 23. They that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
shall consider that the heart of a sinner is hardened through the deceitfulness
of sin, and that the greatest part of the affrightment that
molests the consciences of such is from Satan’s fury and malice, they
will easily conceive how much his single forbearance to molest may
contribute to the peace and ease of those that are ‘settled upon their
lees;’ but besides his forbearance, we may expect that whatever clouds
or darkness he can raise to exclude the light, or to muffle the eyes, he
will not be negligent in the use of that power. Whatever he can
positively do, in the raising up the confidence of presumption or
security in the minds of men, whatever he can do to make them sottish
or careless, that shall not be wanting.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, He shews no less skill and diligence <i>by secret contrivances
to hinder occasions of reproof and discovery</i>. How much he
can practise upon others, that out of pity and compassion to the souls
of men, are ready to draw a sinner ‘from the error of his way, and to
save a soul from death!’ [James v. 20.] We can scarce imagine what
ways he hath to divert and hinder them. By what private discouragements
he doth defer them, who can tell? He that could dispute with
the angel about the body of Moses to prevent the secret interment of
it, Jude 9; he that could give a stop of one and twenty days to the
angel that was to bring the comfortable message to Daniel, chap.
x. 13, of the hearing of his prayers, may more easily obstruct and
oppose the designs of a faithful reprover. Sometime he doth this by
visible means and instruments, stirring up the spirits of wicked men
to give opposition to such as seek to deliver their souls from the blood
of men, by faithful warnings or exhortations. The devil was so careful
to keep Jeroboam quiet in his sinful course of idolatry, that he stirs
up Amaziah to banish Amos from the court, lest his plain dealing
should startle or awaken the conscience of the king: Amos vii. 12, 13,
‘Go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, &amp;c.; but prophesy not any
more at Bethel, for it is the king’s chapel, it is the king’s court.’</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, In order to the keeping out the light from the consciences
of men, he insinuates himself <i>as a lying spirit into the mouths
of some of his mercenaries</i>; and they speak ‘smooth things’ and
deceit to Satan’s captives, telling them that they are in a good condition,
Christians good enough, and may go to heaven as well as the
precisest. It is a fault in unfaithful ministers, they do the devil this
service. God highly complains of it: Jer. vi. 14, ‘They have healed
also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace,
peace; when there is no peace;’ Ezek. xiii. 10, ‘They have seduced
my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up
a wall, and others daubed it with untempered mortar.’ Besides,
this stratagem is the more likely to prevail, because it takes the advantage
of the humours and inclinations of men, who naturally think the
best of themselves, and delight that others should speak what they
would have them; so that when men by the devil’s instigation prophesy
deceit to sinful men, it is most likely they should be heard, seeing they
desire such prophets, ‘and love to have it so.’</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, Satan keeps off the light, by <i>catching away the word
after it is sown</i>. This policy of his, Christ expressly discovers: Mat.
xiii. 19, ‘When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>standeth
it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that
which was sown in his heart.’ Such opportunities the devil doth
narrowly watch. To be sure, he will be present at a sermon or good
discourse, and if he perceive anything spoken that may endanger his
peaceable possession, how busy is he to withdraw the heart, sometime
by the sight of the eyes, sometimes by vain thoughts of business,
occasions, delights, and what not; and if this come not up to his end,
then he endeavours, after men have heard, to justle all out by impertinent
discourses, urgencies of employment, and a thousand such
divertisements, that so men may not lay the warning to heart, nor by
serious meditation to apply it to their consciences.</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, He sometimes <i>snuffs out the light by persecution</i>. Those
hearers, Mat. xiii. 20, 21, that had received the word with some
workings of affections and joy, are ‘presently offended when persecution,
because of the word, ariseth.’ By this he threatens men into
an acquiescency in their present condition, that if they ‘depart from
iniquity, they shall make themselves a prey,’ [Isa. lix. 15.] Bonds,
imprisonments, and hatreds, he suggests, shall abide them, and by this
means he scares men from the light.</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, He sometimes <i>smothers and chokes it with the cares of
the world</i>, as those that received seed among thorns. By earnest
engagements in business, all that time, strength, and affection which
should have been laid out in the prosecution of heavenly things, are
wholly taken up and spent on outward things. By this means that light
that shines into the hearts of men is neglected and put by.</p>

<p>7. Seventhly, He staves off men from coming to the light, by putting
them upon <i>misapprehensions of their estate in judging themselves by
the common opinion</i>. Satan hath so far prevailed with men, that they
are become confident of this conceit, that men may take a moderate
liberty in sinning, and yet nevertheless be in a good condition; that
sin is not so great a matter in God’s esteem, as in the judgment of some
rigorous precisian; that he will not be so extreme to mark what we do
amiss, as some strict professors are. What can be of greater hindrance
to that ingenuous search, strict examination, and impartial judging or
shaming ourselves for our iniquities, which the light of Scripture would
engage us unto, than such a conceit as this! And yet that this opinion
is not only common, but ancient, is manifest by those warnings and
cautions given by the apostle to the contrary: Gal. vi. 7, ‘Be not
deceived; God is not mocked: whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
also reap;’ Eph. v. 6, ‘Let no man deceive you with vain words: for
because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
disobedience.’ If it had not been usual for men to live in uncleanness,
covetousness, and such like offences, which he calls ‘sowing to the
flesh,’ and yet in the midst of these to think they were not under the
hazard of wrath, or if men had not professedly and avowedly maintained
such an opinion, it had been superfluous for the apostle to have
warned us with so much earnestness, ‘Be not deceived; let no man
deceive you with such vain words,’ [1 Cor. vi. 9.]</p>

<p>8. Eighthly, It is usual for Satan to still and quiet the stirring
thoughts of sinners <i>with hopes and assurances of secrecy</i>. As children
are quieted and pleased with toys and rattles, so are sinners put off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
and diverted from prosecuting the discoveries that the light would
make in them, by this confidence, that though they have done amiss,
yet their miscarriages shall not be laid open or manifested before men.
It is incredible how much the hopes of concealment doth satisfy and
delight those that have some sense of guilt. Sometime men are impudent,
that ‘they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not,’ Isa.
iii. 9. But before they arrive at so great an impudency, they usually
‘seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in
the dark; and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?’ Isa.
xxix. 15. Like those foolish creatures that think themselves sufficiently
concealed by hiding their heads in a bush, though all their bodies be
exposed to open view, Isa. xxviii. 15, those that made ‘lies their
refuge, and under falsehood hid themselves,’ became as confident of
their security as if they had ‘made a covenant with death, and were
at an agreement with hell;’ and when they have continued in this
course for some time with impunity, the light is so banished that they
carry it so as if God observed their actions done in the dark as little
as men do. ‘How doth God know?’ say they; ‘can he judge through
the dark clouds? thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth
not,’ Job xxii. 13. And hence proceed they to promise themselves a
safety from judgments: ‘When the overflowing scourge shall pass
through, it shall not come nigh unto us, for we have made lies our
refuge,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>9. Ninthly, Satan keeps them from going to the light by <i>demurs
and delays</i>. If the light begin to break in upon their consciences,
then he tells them that there is time enough afterward. Oh, saith he,
thou art young, and hast many days before thee; it is time enough to
repent when you begin to be old. Or thou art a servant, an apprentice
under command, thou wantest fit opportunities and conveniences
for serious consideration, defer till thou becomest free, and at thine
own disposal. That this is one of Satan’s deceits to hinder us from
making use of the light, besides what common experience may teach
every man, may be clearly gathered from the exhortations of Scripture,
which do not only shew us ‘the way wherein we ought to walk,’ but
also press us to a present embracement of that counsel: ‘To-day, to-day,
while it is called to-day, harden not your hearts;’ ‘Now is the
accepted time, now is the day of salvation;’ ‘Remember thy Creator
in the days of thy youth, before the evil day comes;’ ‘If ye will enquire,
enquire: yea, return, come,’ Heb. iii. 7; 2 Cor. vi. 2; Eccles.
xii. 1; Isa. xxi. 12. This hasty urgency to close with the offered
occasions, plainly accuse us of delays, and that it is usual with us to
adjourn those thoughts to a fitter opportunity, which we are not
willing to comply with for the present.</p>

<p>By these nine devices he keeps the light from ensnared sinners, or
them from coming to the light. But if all this cannot draw a curtain
before the sun, if its bright beams breaks through all, so that it cannot
be avoided, but there will be a manifestation and discovery of ‘the
hidden things of darkness,’ then Satan useth all his art and cunning
to stir up in the hearts of men their hatred against the light.</p>

<p>This is his second grand piece of policy to keep all in quiet under
his command, to which purpose,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>1. First, He endeavours to draw on a hatred against the light, by
raising in the minds of men <i>a prejudice against the person that brings
or offers it</i>. If he that warns or reproves express himself anything
warmly or cuttingly against his brother’s sins, this the devil presently
makes use of; and those that are concerned think they have a just
cause to ‘stop their ears and harden their necks,’ because they conceive
that anger, or ill-will, or some such base thing did dictate those,
though just, rebukes. The devil turned the heart of Ahab against the
faithful warnings of Micaiah upon a deep prejudice that he had taken
up against him; for so he expresseth himself to Jehoshaphat, ‘I hate
him, for he never prophesieth good unto me,’ 1 Kings xxii. 8. In
this case men consider not how justly, how truly, how profitably anything
is spoken; but, as some insects that feed upon sores, they pass
by what is sound and good, and fix upon that which is corrupt and
putrid, either through the weakness and inobservancy of the reprover,
or pretended to be such, by the prejudice of the party which doth
altogether disable him to put a right construction upon anything.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, If this help not, then he seeks to get the advantage <i>of
a provoked, passionate, or otherwise distempered fit</i>; and then hatred
is easily procured against anything that comes in its way.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, Satan endeavours to engage our hatred against the light,
by presenting our <i>interest as shaken or endangered by it</i>. If interest
can be drawn in and made a party, it is not difficult to put all the
passions of a man in arms, to give open defiance to any discovery it
can make. That great rage and tumult of kings and people mentioned
in Psalm ii., combining and taking counsel against the Lord
and his laws, is upon the quarrel of interest. Their suspicions and
jealousies that the setting up of Christ upon his throne would eclipse
their power and greatness, makes them, out of a desperate hatred against
the light, fall into resolves of open rebellion against his laws: ‘Let us
break his bands asunder, and cast away his cords from us.’ This pretence
of interest strengthened the accusation of Amaziah against Amos:
chap. vii. 10, ‘Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house
of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.’ No wonder, then,
if Jeroboam, instead of hearkening to the threatening, banish him out of
the land. We find the like in Asa, a good man; the devil stirs up his
hatred against the seer: ‘He was wroth with him, and put him in the
prison-house; for he was in a rage against him,’ 2 Chron. xvi. 10.
The ground of that rage was this: the king’s interest, in his apprehension,
was wrapped up in that league with the king of Syria, ver. 2, 3,
so that he could not bear so plain a reproof, which directly laid the
axe to the root of so great an interest as the safety of the king and
kingdom, which seemed to depend so much upon that league.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, Satan stirs up hatred against the light from the <i>unavoidable
effects of light, which are discovery and manifestation</i>:
Eph. v. 13, ‘All things that are reproved are made manifest; for
whatsoever doth make manifest is light.’ Now the issue of this manifestation
is shame, which however it be the daughter of sin and light,
yet would it naturally destroy the sin that bred it; and therefore
repentance is usually expressed by being ‘ashamed and confounded:’
but that Satan might avoid this, he turns the edge of shame against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
the light, which should have been employed against sin. When men
therefore have sinned, and are as ‘a thief when he is taken,’ Jer. ii.
26, ready to fall into the hands of shame; for the avoiding of that,
they ‘rebel against the light,’ Job xxiv. 13. The ground of this
hatred, Christ, in John iii. 20, tells us, is ‘lest their deeds should be
reproved,’ and they forced to bear their shame. To this end they are
put upon it to hide themselves from shame by lies, pretences, excuses,
extenuations, or by any fig-leaf that comes first to hand. And as those
that live in hotter regions curse the sun because it scorcheth them, so
do these curse the light: and instead of taking its help, raise up an
irreconcilable enmity against it; and so run from it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s third grand policy for maintaining his possession; which
is his feigned departure:</i> (1.) <i>By ceasing the prosecution of his
design; and the cases in which he doth it.</i> (2.) <i>By abating the
eagerness of pursuit; and how he doth that.</i> (3.) <i>By exchanging
temptations; and his policy therein.—The advantage he seeks by
seeming to fly.—Of his fourth stratagem for keeping his possession,
which is his stopping all ways of retreat; and how he doth
that.</i></p>


<p>Besides the two former designs, of finishing sin, and keeping all
in quiet, by which the devil endeavours to maintain his possession, he
hath a third grand subtlety, which is this: he keeps his hold by
feigning himself dispossessed and cast out. Of this we have a full
account: Luke xi. 24, ‘When the unclean spirit is gone out of a
man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none,
he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.’ Christ
had there noted that it is Satan’s great principle to do nothing by
which his kingdom may be divided or undermined. Satan will not
be divided against himself, and yet very seasonably he tells us, that
for an advantage he will seem to quit his interest, and upon design
he will sometimes so carry himself that he may be deemed and supposed
to be ‘gone out of a man;’ as those that besiege forts or walled
towns do sometimes raise the siege and feign a departure, intending
thereby to take a sudden advantage of the carelessness of the besieged.
In the explanation of this policy, I shall, (1.) Shew how
many ways he feigns a departure. (2.) Upon what designs he
doth it.</p>

<p>There are three ways whereby Satan seems to forsake his interest:—</p>

<p>1. First, He frequently <i>ceaseth the prosecution of a design, which
yet he hath in his eye and desire, when he perceives that there are
some things in his way that render it not feasible</i>; nay, he forbears
to urge men to their darling sins, upon the same score: and who
would not think Satan cast out in such a case? When a man spits
out the sweet morsel which heretofore he kept under his tongue, and
sucked a sweetness from it; when men of noted iniquities abstain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
from them, and become smooth and civil, who would not think but
that the unclean spirit were gone? This way and course he puts in
practice in several cases.</p>

<p>[1.] First, When he perceives some <i>extraordinary occasion puts
any of his subjects into a good mood or humour of religion</i>. Wicked
men are not ordinarily so highly bent upon evil ways, but that they
may be at some times softened and relaxed. Pharaoh, who is most
eminently noted for a heart judicially hardened, at the appearance of
the plagues upon himself and Egypt, usually relented somewhat, and
would confess he had sinned, and that fit would continue upon him
for some little time. But very frequently it is thus with others; an
extraordinary occasion melts and thaws down the natural affections of
men, as a warm day melts the snow upon the mountains, and then
the stream will for a time run high and strong, at which time Satan
sees it is in vain to urge them. Thus men that receive an eminent
kindness and deliverance from God, what is more common than for
such men to say, Oh, we will never be so wicked as we have been, we
will never be drunk more, the world shall see us reformed and new
men! These are indeed good words, and yet though Satan knows
that such expressions are not from a good heart,—as that of Deut. v.
29 implies, ‘They have well said, Oh that there were such an heart
in them!’—he nevertheless thinks it not fit then to press them to their
usual wickedness at that time; for natural affections raised high in a
profession of religion will withstand temptations for a fit, and therefore
he forbears till the stream run lower. What a fit of affection
had the Israelites when their eyes had seen that miraculous deliverance
at the Red Sea! What songs of rejoicing had they! what resolves
never to distrust him again! Ps. cvi. 12, ‘Then believed they
his words, they sang his praise.’ Satan doth not presently urge them
to murmuring and unbelief, though that was his design, but he stays
till the fit was over, and then he could soon tempt them to ‘forget
his works.’ How like a convert did Saul look, after David had convinced
him of his integrity, and had spared his life in the cave!
1 Sam. xxiv. 16, and xxvi. 21. He weeps, and acknowledgeth his
iniquity, justifies David, owns his kindness, and seems to acquiesce in
his succession to the kingdom. The devil had, no question, a great
spite at David, and it was his great design to stir up Saul against
him, and yet at that time he could not prevail with him to destroy
David, though he might easily have done it; he was then in a good
mood, and Satan was forced to give way to necessity, and to seem to
go out of Saul for the present.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He also ceaseth from his design when he sees he
cannot fit his temptation with a <i>suitable opportunity</i>. What could
be more the devil’s design, and Esau’s satisfaction, than to have had
Jacob slain? Esau professeth it was the design of his heart, and
yet he resolves to forbear so long as his father Isaac lived: Gen.
xxvii. 41, ‘The days of my father’s mourning are at hand; then,
but not till then, will I slay my brother Jacob.’ The devil often
sows his seed, and yet waiteth and hath long patience, not only in
watering and fitting the hearts of men for it, but also in expectancy
of fit opportunities; and in the meantime, he forbears to put men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
upon that which time and occasion cannot fitly bring forth to practice.
The prophet, Hosea vii. 4, speaks of that people as notoriously
wicked, ‘they are all adulterers;’ but withal, he observes that they
forbare these enormous abominations for want of fit seasons, ‘their
heart was as an oven heated by the baker,’ sufficiently enflamed after
their wickedness, and yet the baker, after he had kneaded the dough,
prepared all the groundwork of the temptation, ceased from raising,
sleeping all the night till all was leavened; that is, though their
hearts were enraged for sin, yet the devil doth wait till occasions present
themselves, and becomes in the meantime like one asleep. Now
while the devil thus sleeps, the fire that is secretly in the heart, being
not seen, men gain the good opinion of converts with others, and
often with themselves, not knowing what spirit they are of, because
Satan ceaseth, upon the want of occasions, to tempt and provoke
them.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Our adversary is content to forbear, when he perceives
that <i>a restraining grace doth lock up the hearts and hands of
men</i>. When ‘a stronger than he cometh,’ who can expect less but
that he should be more quiet? That God doth restrain men sometime
when he doth not change them, needs no proof; that Satan
knows of these restraints, cannot be denied. Who can give an
account of these communings and discourses that are betwixt God
and Satan concerning us? His pleadings in reference to Job were as
unknown to Job, till God discovered them, as his pleadings concerning
ourselves are to us. Besides, who can tell how much of God’s restraining
grace may lie in this, of God’s limiting and straitening Satan’s
commission? Now the devil hath not so badly improved his observations,
but that he knows it is in vain to tempt where God doth stop
his way and tie up men’s hands. Abimelech was certainly resolved
upon wickedness when he took Sarah from Abraham, Gen. xx. 2,
and yet the matter is so carried for some time, how long we know
not, as if the devil had been asleep, or forgot to hasten Abimelech to
his intended wickedness; for when God cautions him, ‘he had not
come near her,’ ver. 4. The ground of all this was neither in the
devil’s backwardness nor Abimelech’s modesty, but Satan lets the
matter rest, because he knew that ‘God withheld him, and suffered
him not to touch her.’</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, When men are under <i>the awe and fear of such as
carry an authority in their countenances and employments for the
discouraging of sin</i>, Satan, as hopeless to prevail, doth not solicit to
scandalous iniquities. Much of external sanctity and saintlike behaviour
ariseth from hence. The faces and presence of some men
have such a shining splendour, that iniquity blusheth and hideth its
head before them. Sin dare not do what it would; so great a reverence
and esteem of such persons is kept up in the consciences of
some, and so great an awe and fear is thence derived to others, that
they will not or dare not give way to an insolency in evil. The
Israelites were generally a wicked people, yet such an awe they had
of ‘Joshua, and the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the
great works of the Lord,’ Josh. ii. 7, that Satan seemed to be cast out
all their days. Who could have thought Joash had been so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
under Satan’s power, that had observed his ways all the time of
Jehoiada the priest? 2 Chron. xxiv. 2, ‘Then he did that which was
right in the sight of the Lord.’ Satan was content to let him alone,
because Jehoiada’s life and authority did overawe him; but after his
death Satan returned to his possession, ‘and the king hearkened to
the princes of Judah, and served groves and idols,’ ver. 17. The
like is observed of Uzziah, 2 Chron. xxvi. 5. The reverence that
he had for Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God,
discouraged the tempter from soliciting him to those evils which
afterward he engaged him in, ver. 16. Satan is willing, when he
perceives the awe and authority of good men stands in his way,
rather to suspend the prosecution of his design, than, by forcing it
against so strong a current, to hazard the shipwreck of it.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, He also makes as if he were cast out when he perceives
<i>the consciences of men are scared by threatened or felt judgments</i>. He
forbears to urge them against the pricks when God draws his sword and
brings forth the glittering spear. Balaam’s ass would not run against
the angel that appeared terribly against him in his way. The devil
knows the power of an awakened conscience, and sees it in vain to
strive against such a stream; and when it will be no better he withdraws.
As great a power as the devil had in Ahab, when he was
affrighted and humbled he gave way, and for that season drave him
not on to his wonted practice of wickedness. He also carried thus to
the Ninevites, when they were awakened by the preaching of Jonah.
Then we see them a reforming people, the devil surceased to carry
them into their former provocations. How frequently is this seen
among professors, where the word hath a searching power and force
upon them! Sin is so curbed and kept under, that it is like a root of
bitterness in winter, lying hid under ground, Satan forbearing to act
upon it or to improve it, till the storms and noise of judgments cease,
and then usually it will ‘spring up and trouble them,’ Heb. xii. 15.
If Satan hath really lost his hold, he ceaseth not to molest and vex
even awakened consciences with urgent solicitations to sin; but if he
perceive that his interest in the hearts of men remains sure to him and
unshaken, then, in case of affrightment and fear of wrath, it is his
policy to conceal himself, and to dissemble a departure.</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, Satan is also forced to this by the <i>prevailing power of
knowledge and principles of light</i>. Where the gospel in profession and
preaching displays abroad his bright beams, then whatever shift men
make to be wicked in secret, yet ‘the light is as the shadow of death
to them,’ and it is even ‘a shame to speak of these things in public,’
Eph. v. 12. Here Satan cannot rage so freely, but is put to his shifts,
and is forced to be silent, whilst the power of the gospel cuts off half
his garments. Men begin to reform; some are clean escaped from
error, 2 Pet. ii. 18; others abandon their filthy lusts and scandalous
sins, and so ‘escape the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,’ ver. 20. Yet under all these
great alterations and appearances of amendment, the devil is but
seemingly ejected; for in the place mentioned, when the light declines,
those that were escaped from error, and those that had fled
from sinful pollutions, were both entangled again and carried to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
same pitch, and a great deal further, of that sin and error in which
they had been formerly engaged.</p>

<p>These are the six cases in which Satan ceaseth the prosecution of
his design, which was his first policy in feigning himself to be cast
out; but he further dissembles a flight when he thinks it not fit to
cease wholly,</p>

<p><i>By abating his pursuit</i>, by slacking his course; and this he doth,</p>

<p>[1.] First, When he tempts still, but yet <i>less than formerly</i>. So
great is his cunning and patience, that when he cannot get what he
would have, he contents himself with what he can get, rather than lose
all. He desires that men would give up themselves fully and freely
to his service; but if they like not this, he is willing to take them, as
one speaks, as retainers, and to suffer them to take a liberty to come
and go at pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_196_196" href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> He hath two main ends in tempting men to sin:
one is to avenge himself upon God, in open defiance and dishonour of
his name; the other is the ruin and perdition of souls. If he could,
he would have these two ends meet in every temptation; yet he
pleaseth himself with the latter when he cannot help it, and in that
too he satisfies himself sometimes with as small an interest as may be,
so that his possession and interest be but preserved. He knows that
one sin loved and embraced brings death for its wages. A leak unstopped
and neglected may sink the ship as well as a great storm;
and therefore when he perceives the consciences of men shy and nice,
he is willing they come to him, as Nicodemus came to Christ, by night
in private, and that by stealth they do him service.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He sometimes offers men <i>a composition, and so keeps
his hold privately, by giving them an indulgence and toleration to comply
with religious duties and observations</i>. Pharaoh condescended
that Israel should go and serve the Lord in the wilderness, upon condition
that their wives, children, and substance were left behind. So
Satan saith to some, ‘Go and serve the Lord,’ only let your heart be
with me; leave your affections behind upon the world. That serious
warning of Christ, ‘Ye cannot serve two masters; ye cannot serve
God and mammon,’ evidently shews that the devil useth to conceal
his interest in the hearts of sinners by offering such terms; and that
men are so apt to think that Satan is gone out when they have shared
the heart betwixt God and him, that they stand in need of a full discovery
of that cheat, and earnest caution against it. The devil was
forced to yield, that Herod should do many things at the preaching of
John; yet he maintained his possession of his heart, by fixing him in
his resolved lust in the matter of Herodias: and this gives just ground
of complaint against the generality of sinners, ‘Ye return, but not to
me, not with your whole hearts: have ye fasted to me? have ye
mourned to me? they come and sit as my people, but their hearts are
after their covetousness,’ [Ezek. xxxiii. 31.]</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Satan hath yet another wile by which he would cheat
men into a belief that he is cast out of the heart; and this is a subtle
way that he hath <i>to exchange temptations</i>. How weak and childish
are sinners that suffer themselves thus to be abused! When they
grow sick and weary of a sin, if the devil take that from them, and lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
in the room of it another as bad, or the same again, only a little
changed and altered, they please themselves that they have vomited
up the first, but consider not that they have received into their embracement
another as bad or worse. Concerning this exchange, we
may note two things:—</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That sometimes he attains his end by exchanging <i>one heinous
sin for another as heinous, only not so much out of fashion</i>: as the
customs and times and places give laws and rules for fashions, according
to which the decencies or indecencies of garbs and garments are
determined, so is it sometimes with sin. Men and countries have
their darling sins; times and ages also have their peculiar iniquities,
which, in the judgment of sinners, do clothe them with a fitness and
suitableness. Sometimes men grow weary of sins, because they are
everywhere spoken against; because men point at them with the
finger. The devil in this case is ready to change with them. Drunkenness
hath in some ages and places carried a brand of infamy in its
forehead; so hath uncleanness and other sins. When sinners cannot
practise these with credit and reputation, then they please themselves
with an alteration. He that was a drunkard is now, it may be, grown
ambitious and boasting; he that was covetous is become a prodigal
or profuse waster; the heart is as vain and sottish as before, only
their lusts are let out another way, and run in another channel. Sometimes
lusts are changed also with the change of men’s condition in the
world. Poverty and plenty, a private and a public station, have their
peculiar sins. He that of poor is made rich leaves his sins of distrust,
envy, or deceitful dealing, and follows the bias of his present state to
other wickednesses equally remarkable, and yet may be so blinded as
to apprehend that Satan is departed from him.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, We may observe that Satan exchangeth sins with men in
such <i>a secret private manner, that the change is not easily discovered</i>;
and by this shift he casts a greater mist before the eyes of men. Thus
he exchangeth open profaneness into secret sins: filthiness of the flesh
into filthiness of the spirit. Men seem to reform their gross impieties,
abstaining from drunkenness, swearing, adulteries; and then, it
may be, they are taken up with spiritual pride, and their hearts are
puffed up with high conceits of themselves, their gifts and attainments;
or they are entangled with error, and spend their time in ‘doting about
questions that engender strife rather than edifying,’ [1 Tim. vi. 4;]
or they are taken up with hypocrisies. Thus the Pharisees left their
open iniquities, washing the outside of the cup and platter, Mat. xxiii.
26; and instead of these, endeavoured to varnish and paint themselves
over, so that in all this change they were but as graves that appeared
not, Luke xi. 44. Or they acquiesce in formality and the outwards of
religion; like that proud boaster, ‘Lord, I thank thee I am not as
other men are,’ &amp;c., [Luke xviii. 11.] In all these things the devil
seems cast out and men reformed, when indeed he may continue his
possession; only he lurks and hides himself under ‘the stuff,’ [1 Sam.
x. 22.] These ways of sinning are but finer poisons, which, though
not so nauseous to the stomach, nor so quick in their despatch, yet
may be as surely and certainly deadly; such fly from the iron weapon,
and a bow of steel strikes them through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>Having thus explained the three ways by which Satan pretends to
depart from men, I must next shew his design in making such a pretence
of forsaking his habitation.</p>

<p>[1.] First, That all this is done by him only <i>upon design</i>, may be
easily concluded from several things hinted to us in the fore-cited place
of Luke xi. As (1.) He doth not say that the devil is ‘cast out,’ as
if there were a force upon him, but that he ‘goeth out;’ it is of choice,
a voluntary departure. (2.) That his going out in this sense is notwithstanding
irksome and troublesome to him. The heart of man, as
one observes,<a id="FNanchor_197_197" href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> is a palace in his estimation, and dispossession, though
upon design, is as a ‘desert’ to him, that affords him little ease or rest.
(3.) That his going out is not a quitting of his interest; he calls it
‘<i>his</i> house’ still: ‘I will return to <i>my</i> house,’ saith he. (4.) He takes
care in going out to lock the door, that it may not be taken up with
better guests; he keeps it ‘empty’ and tenantable for himself: he
tempts still, though not so visibly, and strives to suppress such good
thoughts and motions as he fears may quite out him of his possession.
(5.) He goes out, <i>cum animo revertendi</i>, with a purpose of returning.
(6.) His secession is so dexterously and advantageously managed, that
he finds an easy admittance at his return, and his possession confirmed
and enlarged: ‘they enter in and dwell there.’</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>The advantages that he designs by this policy
are these chiefly</i>: (1.) By this means men are dangerously confirmed
<i>in their securities</i>. Thus the Pharisee blessed himself,
‘Lord, I thank thee,’ &amp;c. They please themselves with this supposition,
that the devil is cast out; and upon this they cease their
war and watchfulness. As Saul, when he heard that David had
escaped, ‘went not out to seek after him;’ so these trouble not themselves
any further to inquire Satan’s haunts in their hearts. Thus
he sits securely within, whilst they think he is fled from them.
(2.) By this means also he fits men as instruments <i>to serve his turn
in other works of his</i>. He must have, in some cases, handsome tools
to work withal. All men are not fit agents in persecution, either to
credit it, or to carry it through with vigour and zeal; for this end he
seems to go out of some, that under a smoother and profession-like
behaviour, when they are stirred up to persecute, the rigour might
seem just. Thus ‘devout and honourable women’ were stirred up to
persecute Paul and Barnabas, Acts xiii. 50. The devil had gone out
so far, that they had gained the reputation of devout, and then their
zeal would easily take fire for persecution, and withal put a respect
and credit upon it; for who would readily suspect that to be evil or
Satan’s design, which is carried on by such instruments? Besides,
if he at any time intends to blemish the good ways of God by the
miscarriages of professors, he fetcheth his arrow out of this quiver
usually; if he brings a refined hypocrite to a scandalous sin, then
doth the mouth of wickedness open itself to blaspheme ‘the generation
of the just,’ as if none were better. Such agents could not be so
commonly at hand for such a service, if Satan did not in the ways
aforementioned seem to go out of men. (3.) It is another part of his
design, after a pretended departure, to take the advantage of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
security, to return with greater strength and force. This Christ
particularly notes, ‘Then taketh he seven spirits worse than himself,’
&amp;c. Such, as Peter tells us, being ‘again entangled, are totally overcome,
and their latter end is worse with them than their beginning,’
2 Pet. ii. 20. How many might I name, if it were convenient, that
I have known and observed, exactly answering this description of the
apostle, that have for some years left off their wicked ways, and engaged
for a profession of religion; and yet at last ‘have returned like the dog
to his own vomit again’! The devil, when he fights after the Parthian
manner—<i>Terga vertentes metuendi Parthi</i>—is most to be feared; when
he turns his back, he shoots most envenomed arrows, and whom he
so wounds, he commonly wounds them to the death.</p>

<p>The fourth and last stratagem of Satan for the keeping his possession,
is <i>to stop the way, to barricade up all passages, that there may
be no possibility of escape or retreat</i>. When he perceives that his
former ways of policy are not sufficient, but that his slaves and servants
are so far enlightened in the discovery of the danger that they are
ready to turn back from him, then he bestirs himself to oppose their
revolt; and as God sometimes ‘hedgeth up the way’ of sinners with
‘thorns,’ that they should not follow their old lovers, so doth Satan,
Hosea ii. 6; to which purpose,</p>

<p>[1.] First, He endeavours to turn them off such resolutions, by
threatening <i>to reduce them with a strong hand</i>. Here he boasts and
vaunts of his power and sinners’ weakness; as Rabshakeh did against
Hezekiah, ‘What is that confidence wherein thou trustest? have the
gods of Hamath and Arpad,’ &amp;c., ‘delivered their land out of my hand?’
[2 Kings xviii. 33, 34.] Have those that have gone before you been
able to deliver themselves from me? Have they been able to rescue
themselves? Did I not force those that were stronger than you?
Did I not make David number the people? Did I not overcome
him in the matter of Uriah? Did I not compel Peter to deny his
Lord, notwithstanding his solemn profession to the contrary? And
can you think to break away from me so easily? By this means he
would weaken their heart, and enfeeble their resolutions, that they
might sit down under their bondage, as hopeless ever to recover themselves
from his snare: but if these affrightments hinder not, if, notwithstanding
these brags, sinners prepare themselves to turn from sin
to God; then,</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He <i>improves all he can that distance which sin hath
made betwixt God and them</i>. Sins of ordinary infirmity and common
incursion do not so break the peace of God’s children, as sins of a
higher nature do. Even in the saints themselves, we may observe, after
notorious transgression, (1.) That the acquaintance and familiarity
betwixt God and them is immediately broken. What a speedy
alteration is made! How suddenly are all things changed! God
hides himself. The sun that shined but now, and did afford a very
comfortable and cherishing heat, before we are aware, is now hid in a
cloud. Our warmth and refreshments are turned into cold and chillness.
There is also a change on our part, and that suddenly. As in the
resurrection, we shall be changed ‘in the twinkling of an eye;’ so
here, in a moment, our joys flag and decay, our delights grow dull,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
our activity is impaired, we are bound and frozen up, and it is altogether
winter with the soul. (2.) It may be noted, that this begets
an enstrangement in us, and we so carry it as if we had resolved not
to renew our league with God; for though we are not altogether so
desperate as to make formal resolutions of continuing in sin, of casting
off God, and bidding an everlasting farewell to our former acquaintance;
though we do not say, We will now undo ourselves quite, and
harden ourselves in our rebellion; yet sin hath left us in such a maze,
and filled us with so many damps and misgiving thoughts, that we
do not think of returning; we are at a stand, and like a mighty man
astonished that cannot find his hands. We perceive we have lost
so much, and have run into such great unkindnesses, that, like broken
merchants, nothing is more irksome and tedious than to review our
ways, or look into our debt-books. Instead of this, we endeavour to
divert our thoughts, to cast off care, as if we conceived that time
would eat it out, and that then of course we might fall into the old
channel of freedom and comfort. (3.) When we return at last, oh,
with what bashfulness and amazedness do we appear at our next
supplications! what blushing, what damps, what apology! Nay,
sometimes as the man without the wedding garment, ‘we are speechless!’
[Mat. xxii. 12.] How rightly doth such a man resemble the
publican confessing, and the prodigal supplicating. While consulting
what to say for himself, he now begins to feel with what sense and
feeling the prophets and holy men of old used to express themselves
in their confessions, ‘We blush, we are ashamed, astonished, and
confounded.’ This distance sin makes betwixt saints and God sometimes;
but betwixt God and the unconverted it is far greater. Now,
when either an unconverted sinner or a fallen saint puts himself to
look to God for reconciliation, then doth the devil labour to improve
this for their hindrance. That he accuseth us to God, is evident by
Satan’s standing at Joshua’s right hand, Zech. iii. 1. How he accuseth
God to us we know. He tells us it is in vain to seek to make up our
peace after so great provocations; urging that he is ‘a jealous God,’
‘of pure eyes,’ highly resenting the affronts we have given him, &amp;c.
Nay, he goes so high this way, that God is put to it in Scripture, of
purpose to furnish us with an answer to these objections, to proclaim
that he is ‘slow to anger,’ ‘not easily provoked;’ that if men return
from the evil of their ways, he will ‘return to them,’ ‘accept,’ and
‘pity’ them, &amp;c.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, If this divert them not, but that they still persist in
their resolves, then he <i>follows after them with a high hand</i>; sometimes,
as Pharaoh did with Israel, he grows severe and imperious
with them, and redoubles the tale of their bricks. He forceth them
to higher and more frequent iniquities. Sometimes, as the same
Pharaoh, he musters up all his chariots and horsemen to pursue after
them, and in the highest diligence imaginable he brings forth his
greatest power, besetting them on all sides with temptations and
allurements of pleasures and delight. Where he perceives his time
to be short, and his power shaken, he comes down in resolves to try
his utmost strength. And hence it is that converts complain, that
when they begin in earnest to look after God, they are most troubled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
with temptations. Besides this, whatever he can do to make them
‘drive heavily,’ [Exod. xiv. 25,] shall not be wanting. Sometimes he
makes attempts upon their thoughts and affections, which are as their
chariot wheels; and if these can be knocked off any way, it retards
them. Sometimes he casts stumbling-blocks in their way. If any
prejudice may divert them, if threatenings or penalties can hinder; if
the frownings of friends or anything else can put a stop to their
proceedings, he will have them ready. Sometimes he endeavours to
retard them by solicitations of acquaintance, offers of former occasions
and opportunities of sinning, or whatever else may be as a <i>remora</i> to
their intentions.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, But if none of these serve, then, as his last shift, he
<i>proclaims open war against them, pursues them as enemies and rebels</i>.
Now he begins to accuse them for that which they did by his advice
and temptation. Now sins that were called little are aggravated.
Now that day of repentance, which he was wont to say was long, he
tells them it is quite spent, that the sun of their hope is set. Nothing
now doth he suggest but hell, damnation, and wrath; he makes them,
as it were, see it, hear it, and feel it in everything. That interest in
their hearts which he dissembled before, now he stands upon and
asserts, and will not be beat off; designing in all this either to make them
weary of these new resolves by this unusual disquietment and hostility,
or to precipitate them upon some desperate undertaking, or at least
to avenge himself upon them, in venting his malice and rage against
them; but of this more afterward.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Satan’s deceits against religious services and duties.—The grounds of
his displeasure against religious duties.—His first design against
duties is to prevent them.—His several subtleties for that end, by
external hindrances, by indispositions bodily and spiritual, by
discouragements; the ways thereof, by dislike; the grounds thereof,
by sophistical arguings.—His various pleas therein.</i></p>


<p>Our next work is to take notice of the spite and methods of the
serpent against the ways of worship and service. That these are
things against which his heart carries a high fury, and for the overthrow
of them employs no small part of his power and subtlety, needs
no proof, seeing the experience of all the children of God is an
irresistible evidence in this matter. I shall therefore first only set
forth the grounds of his displeasure and earnest undertakings against
them, before I come to his particular ways of deceit, which are
these:—</p>

<p>1. First, By this means, if he prevail, <i>he deprives us of our
weapons</i>. This is a stratagem of war which we find the Philistines
practised against Israel: they took away all their smiths, lest the
Hebrews should make them swords or spears; hence was it that in
the battle there was ‘neither sword nor spear found in the hand of
any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan,’ 1 Sam. xiii. 19,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
22. The word of God is expressly called ‘the sword of the Spirit,’
[Eph. vi. 17.] Prayer is as a spear, or rather a general piece of armour.
If the devil deprive us of these, he robs us of our ammunition; for by
reason of these the church is compared to ‘a tower built for an
armoury, wherein hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty
men,’ Cant. iv. 4; and the apostle expressly calls them ‘weapons of
our warfare,’ 2 Cor. x. 4, of purpose given us for ‘the pulling down
of strongholds,’ and the demolishing of those forts and batteries of
‘high imaginations’ that Satan rears up in the hearts of men against
their happiness. If these be taken away, our locks are cut, as Samson’s
were, our strength is departed, and we become weak as other
men, [Judges xvi. 17,]—we are open to every incursion and inroad
that he pleaseth to make against us.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, If he hinders these, <i>he intercepts our food and cuts off
our provisions</i>. The word is called ‘milk, sincere milk of the word.’
It is that by which we are born, nourished, and increase; it is our
cordial and comfort. Christ indeed is ‘the bread of life,’ and the
fountain of all our consolations, but the word and prayer are the conduit
pipes that convey all to us. If these be cut, we ‘fade as a leaf,’
we languish, we consume and waste, we become as a ‘skin-bottle in
the smoke,’ ‘our moisture as the drought in summer,’ our ‘soul
fainteth,’ ‘our heart faileth, and we become as those that go down to
the pit’; so that if the devil gain his design in this, he hath all.
Give him this, and give him the kingdom also. This is the most
compendious way of doing his work, and that which saves him a
labour in his temptations. The strongest holds, that cannot otherwise
be taken, are easily subdued by famine; and, like fig-trees
with their ripe figs when they are shaken, ‘even fall into the mouth
of the eater,’ Nahum iii. 12. If our spiritual food fail us, of our
own accord we yield up ourselves to any lust that requires our
compliance.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, Besides these, there is no design whereby Satan can
shew <i>more malice and spite against God</i>. He doth all he can to
maintain a competition with the Almighty. His titles of ‘the god of
the world,’ ‘the prince of the power of the air,’ shew what in the pride
of his heart he aspires to, as well as what by commission God is
pleased to grant him. These duties of worship and service are the
homage of God’s children, by which they testify the acknowledgments
of his deity. By wresting these out of our hands, Satan robs God of
that honour, and makes the allegiance of his servants to cease. If he
could do more against God, doubtless he would; but seeing he hath
not ‘an arm like God,’ and so cannot pull him out of heaven, by this
means he sets up himself as the god of the world, and enlargeth his
territories, and staves off the subjects of the God of heaven from giving
him ‘the honour due to his name;’ and that the devil in these
endeavours is carried on by a spite against God, as well as by an
earnest desire of the ruin of souls, may be abundantly evidenced by
his way of management of that opposition that he gives to the duties
of service and worship. I shall only, to make out this, instance in
three things:—(1.) That where the devil prevails to set up himself as
an object of worship, there he doth it in a bold, insolent, presumptu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>ous
imitation of God’s appointments in the ways of his service. He
enjoins covenants, seals, sacrifices, prayers, and services to his miserable
slaves, as may appear by undoubted histories, of which more in
due place. (2.) He never acknowledgeth the truth of God’s ways, but
with an evil mind and upon design to bring them under contempt.
His confessions have so much of deceit in them that Christ would not
accept them; and therefore we read that when the devil was sometime
forward to give his testimony to Christ, as Mark i. 25, ‘I know thee
who thou art, the Holy One of God,’ Jesus rebuked him, and commanded
him to hold his peace. He clearly saw that he confessed him
not to honour him, but by such a particular acknowledgment to stir
up the rage and fury of the people against him. To this end Satan,
in Acts xvi. 17, many days together publicly owns Paul and Silas,
‘These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto
us the way of salvation.’ Though he spake truth, yet had he a
malicious aim in it, which he accordingly brought about by this
means; and that was to raise up persecution against them, and to give
ground to that accusation which they afterwards met withal; ver. 21,
‘That they taught customs which were not lawful to be received.’
But (3.) his particular spite against God in seeking to undermine his
service is further manifested in this, that the devil is not content to
root out the service due to God, but when he hath done that, he delights
to abuse those places where the name of God was most celebrated,
with greatest profanations. I shall not in this insist upon the
conjecture of Tilenus,<a id="FNanchor_198_198" href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> that <i>Sylva Dodonœa</i>, a place highly abused
by the devil, and respected for an oracle, was the seat or a religious
place of Dodanim, mentioned in Gen. x. 4; nor upon that supposal,
mentioned also by the same author, that the oracle of Jupiter Hammon
was the place where Cham [Ham] practised that religious worship
which he learned in his father’s house. We have at hand more
certain evidences of the devil’s spite. Such was his abuse of the
tabernacle by the profane sons of Eli, who profaned that place with
their uncleanness and filthy adulteries. Such was his carriage to the
ark while it was captivated by the Philistines. Of like nature were
his attempts against the temple itself. Solomon in his latter days
was tempted to give an affront to it: he built a high place for Chemosh,
the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem,
1 Kings xi. 7, in the very sight and face of the temple; but afterward
he prepared to defile the temple itself. Gilgal and Beth-aven
are places of such high profanation, that the prophet Hosea, chap. ix. 15,
tells them ‘all their wickedness was in Gilgal,’ none of their abominations
were like to those; and in chap. iv. 15, they are dehorted from
going to Gilgal or Beth-aven; and yet both these places had been
famous for religion before.<a id="FNanchor_199_199" href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> Gilgal was the place of the general circumcision
of the Israelites that were born in the wilderness; there was
their first solemn passover kept after their entering into the land.
Bethel was a place where God as it were kept house, ‘the house of
God.’ Here Jacob had his vision. But the more famous they had
been for duties of worship, the devil sought to put higher abuses upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
them, so that Gilgal became ‘an hatred,’ and Bethel became a Beth-aven,
‘an house of vanity.’</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, Satan is the more animated to undertake a design
against the ways of religious service, because <i>he seldom or never
misseth at least something of success</i>. This attempt is like Saul and
Jonathan’s bow, that ‘returned not empty,’ [2 Sam. i. 22.] In other
temptations sometimes Satan comes off baffled altogether, but in this
work, as it was said of some Israelites, ‘he can throw a stone at an
hair’s breadth, and not miss,’ Judges xx. 16. He is sure in one thing
or other to have the better of us. His advantage in this case is from
our unsuitableness to our service. What we do in the duties of worship,
requires a choice frame of spirit. Our hearts should be awed
with the most serious apprehensions of divine majesty, filled with
reverence, animated with love and delight, quickened by faith, clothed
with humility and self-abhorrency, and in all the procedure of duties
there must be a steady and firm prosecution under the strictest watchfulness.
Of this nature is our work, which at the first view would
put a man to a stand, and out of amazement force him to say, ‘Who
is sufficient for these things? who can stand before such an holy Lord
God?’ But when we come to an impartial consideration of our
manifold weaknesses and insufficiencies in reference to these services,
what shall we say? we find such a narrowness of spirit, such ignorances,
sottishness, carelessness of mind, thoughts so confused, tumultuous,
fickle, slippery, and unconstant, and our hearts generally so deceitful
and desperately wicked, that it is not possible that Satan should altogether
labour in vain or catch nothing. This being then a sure gain,
we may expect it to be under a most constant practice.</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, If he so prevails against us that the services of worship
become <i>grossly abused or neglected, then doth he put us under the
greatest hazards and disadvantages</i>. Nothing so poisonous as duties
of worship corrupted; for this is to abuse God to his face. By this,
not only are his commands and injunctions slighted, as in other sins,
but we carry it so as if we thought him no better than the idols of the
heathens, that have ‘eyes and see not, that have ears and hear not.’
To come without a heart, or with our idols in our heart, is it anything
of less scorn than to say, ‘Tush, doth the Most High see?’
Besides, he hath given such severe cautions and commands in these
matters as will easily signify the aggravation of the offence. You see
how sharply God speaks of those that came to inquire of the Lord
with ‘the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face,’ Ezek.
xiv. 4, 7, ‘I will answer them according to the multitude of their
idols; I will answer them by myself.’ Saul’s miscarriage in offering
sacrifice, 1 Sam. xiii. 13, was that great offence for which God determined
to take the kingdom from him. God’s severity against Nadab
and Abihu, his stroke upon Uzziah, do all shew the hazard of such
profanations. But, above all, that danger which both Old and New
Testament speak of—the hardening of the heart, blinding the eyes,
dulling the ears, that men should not hear nor see nor be converted
and saved, but that the word should, instead of those cordial refreshing
smells which beget and promote spiritual life in the obedient, breathe
forth such envenomed, poisonous exhalations when it is thus abused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
and profaned, that it becomes ‘the savour of death unto death’—is
most dreadful. No wonder, then, if Satan be very busy against these
holy things, when, if he catch us at an advantage of this nature, it
proves so deadly and dangerous to us; for what can more please him
that makes it his delight and employment to destroy?</p>

<p>All these reasons evince that Satan hath an aching tooth against
religious services, and that to weaken, prevent, or overthrow them is
his great endeavour. Here then especially may we expect an assault,
according to the advice of Sirach: Ecclus. ii. 1, 2, ‘My son, when
thou enterest God’s service, stand fast in righteousness and fear, and
prepare thy soul for temptation.’</p>

<p>What are the subtleties of Satan against the holy things of God, I
am next to discover. Duties and services are opposed two ways:
(1.) <i>By prevention</i>, when they are hindered. (2.) <i>By corruption</i>,
when they are spoiled. He hath his arts and cunning, which he
exerciseth in both these regards:—</p>

<p>1. First, then, Of Satan’s policy for the preventing of religious
services. He endeavours by various means to hinder them. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>By external hindrances</i>. In this he hath a very great
foresight, and accordingly he foresees occasions and opportunities at a
distance, and by a long reach of contrivance he studies to lay blocks
and hindrances in the way. Much he doth in the dark for this end
that we know not. As God hath ‘secrets of wisdom that are double
to that which is known,’ Job xi. 6, so also hath Satan many ways and
actings that are not discerned by us. His contrivances of businesses
and avocations long aforehand are not so observed by us as they might
be. Where he misseth of his end it comes not to light, and often
where he is successful in his preventions we are ready to ascribe it to
contingencies and the accidental hits of affairs, when indeed the hand
and policy of Satan is in it. Paul, that was highly studied and skilful
in Satan’s devices, observing how his purposes of coming to the Thessalonians
were often broken and obstructed, he knew where the blame
lay, and therefore instead of laying the fault upon sickness, or imprisonments,
or the oppositions of false brethren—which often made him
trouble beyond expectation—he directly chargeth all upon Satan:
1 Thes. ii. 18, ‘We would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
again, but Satan hindered us.’ At the same rate, understanding the
purposes of faithful men for the promoting the good of men’s souls,
he often useth means to stop or hinder them. Some have observed,
having a watchful and jealous eye over Satan, that their resolves
and endeavours of this nature have usually been put to struggle sore
in their birth when their purposes for worldly affairs and matters go
smoothly on without considerable opposition.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, He makes use of indispositions to hinder service;
and here he works sometimes upon the body, sometimes upon the
soul, for both may be indisposed.</p>

<p>[1.] First, Sometimes he takes the advantage of <i>bodily indispositions</i>.
He doth all he can to create and frame these upon us, and
then pleads them as a discharge to duty. If he can put the body into
a fit of drowsiness or distemper, he will do it: and surely he can do
more this way than every one will believe—he may agitate and stir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the humours. Hence some have observed more frequent and stronger
fits of sleepiness and illness to come upon them on the days and times
that require their attendance upon God, than on other days; when they
shall be lively, active, and free of dulness upon common occasions—at
sports, songs, interludes—when they shall not have the like command
of themselves in the exercises of worship. Surely it was more
than an ordinary drowsiness that befell the apostles, Mat. xxvi. 41. He
had told them the seriousness of the occasion, that he was ‘betrayed,’
that his ‘soul was exceeding sorrowful even to the death:’ these were
considerations that might have kept their eyes from slumber. When
they sleep, he awakens them with a piercing rebuke, ‘Could ye not
watch with me one hour?’ and adds to this an admonition of their
own danger, and the temptation that was upon them, and yet presently
they are asleep again, and after that again. Strange drowsiness! But
he gives an excuse for them, which also tells us the cause of it: the
‘spirit is willing’—their hearts were not altogether unconcerned—‘but
the flesh,’ that is, the body, that was ‘weak’—that is, subject
to be abused by Satan, who brought them into a more than ordinary
indisposition, as is noted ver. 43, ‘their eyes were heavy.’</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>The soul hath also its indispositions</i>, which he readily
improves against duty to hinder it. As,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, It is capable of <i>a spiritual sluggishness and dulness</i>, wherein
the spiritual senses are so bound up, that it considers not, minds not,
hath no list nor inclination to acts of service. What a stupefaction
are our spirits capable of! as David in his adultery seems not to mind
nor care what he had done. In like manner are some in a lethargy;
as the prophet speaks, they ‘care not to seek after God.’ Bernard
hath a description of it: <i>Contrahitur animus, subtrahitur gratia, defervescit
novitius fervor, ingravescit torpor fastidiosus</i>, The spirit is contracted,
grace withdrawn, fervour abates, sluggishness draws on, and
then duties are neglected.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, The spirit is indisposed by <i>a throng of worldly affairs,
and these oft jostle out duty</i>. Christ tells us they have the same
influence upon men that gluttony and drunkenness have, and these
unfit men for action. ‘Take heed,’ saith Luke xxi. 34, ‘to yourselves,
lest at any time your heart be overcharged with surfeiting and
drunkenness, and the cares of this life.’ These then may at so high a
rate overcharge the souls of men so as to make them frame excuses:
‘I have bought a farm or oxen,’ and therefore ‘I cannot attend;’ and
by this means may they grow so neglective that the ‘day of the Lord
may come upon them at unawares.’</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, Sometimes the soul is <i>discomposed through passion</i>, and
then it is indisposed, which opportunity the devil espying, he closeth
in with it. Sometime he ‘blows the fire,’ that the heat of anger may
put them upon a carelessness. Sometimes he pleads their present
frame as an unfitness for service, and so upon a pretence of reverence
to the service, and ‘leaving the gift at the altar’ till they be in a better
humour, many times the gift is not offered at all, 1 Pet. iii. 7. The
apostle directs husbands to manage their authority over their wives
with prudence, for the avoiding of brawls and contentions: ‘Ye husbands,
dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
wife as the weaker vessel;’ the reason of which advice he gives in these
words, ‘that your prayers be not hindered.’ Prayers are hindered
partly in their success when they prevail not, partly they are hindered
when the duty of prayer is put by and suspended; and this doubtless
the apostle aims at, to teach us that contentious quarrellings in a
family hinder the exercise of the duty of prayer. Elisha, 2 Kings iii.,
discomposed himself in his earnest reproof of Jehoram, for with great
vehemency he had spoken to him: ver. 13, 14, ‘What have I to do
with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father. Were it not that
I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, I would not look toward thee, nor
see thee.’ But when he set himself to receive the visions of God, he
calls for a minstrel, ver. 15, the reason whereof, as P[eter] Martyr and
others suppose,<a id="FNanchor_200_200" href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> was this, that however what he spake to Jehoram
proceeded from zeal, yet being but a man, and subject to the like
infirmities of other men, it had distracted and discomposed his spirit,
which made him unfit and uncapable to entertain the visions of God.
Music then being a natural means for the composure and quiet of
the mind, he takes that course to calm and fit himself for that
work.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly, Ignorance and prejudice are spiritual indispositions</i>,
which are not neglected by the devil. Knowledge is the eye and
guide of the soul. If there be darkness there, all acts which depend
upon better instruction must cease. The disciples’ ignorance of Scriptures
brought in their unbelief. Christ notes that as the fountainhead
of all their backwardness: Luke xxiv. 25, ‘O fools, and slow of
heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken.’ In like manner,
if men are not clear or knowing in the ways and necessities of duty
and service, the devil can easily prevail with them to forbear and
neglect. Prejudice riseth up to justify the disregard of duty, and
offers reasons which it thinks cannot be answered.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Satan endeavours to prevent duty <i>by discouragements</i>.
If he can make the ‘knees feeble,’ and the ‘hands hang down,’ he will
quickly cause activity and motion to cease. The ways by which
he endeavours to discourage men from the duties of service are
these:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, He sets before them <i>the toil and burden of duty</i>. If a
man sets his face toward heaven, thus he endeavours to scare him
off: Is not, saith he, the way of religion a dull, melancholy way?
Is it not a toil—a tedious task? Are not these unreasonable injunctions:
‘Pray continually,’ ‘Pray without ceasing,’ ‘Preach in
season and out of season’? This suggestion, though it be expressly
contrary to command, yet being so suitable to the idle and sluggish
tempers of men, they are the more apt to take notice of it, and accordingly
they seek ways and shifts of accommodating the command to
their inclinations. In Amos viii. 5, the toil of sabbaths and festival
services, as they thought it, makes them weary of the duty, ‘When
will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath,
that we may set forth wheat?’ These men thought their services
tedious and entrenching upon their callings and occupations: Mal.
i. 13, ‘They said, Behold, what a weariness is it!’ looking upon it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
an insufferable burden, nay they proceeded so far as to snuff at it.
Now when the devil had so far prevailed with them, it was easy to put
them upon neglect; which, as the place cited speaks, presently followed
upon it, they ‘brought the torn, and the lame, and the sick for
a sacrifice.’ Satan first presented these services as a wearisome
burden, then they snuffed at them; next they thought any service
good enough, how mean soever, though to an open violation of the
law of worship; and lastly, from a pollution of the table of the Lord
they proceeded to a plain contempt of duty, ‘the table of the Lord is
polluted, and the fruit thereof, even his meat is contemptible,’ ver. 12.
In the management of this discouragement, the devil hath most success
upon those that have not yet tasted the sweetness and easiness of
the ways of the Lord, ‘his yoke is indeed easy, his burden is light;’
his service is a true freedom to those that are acquainted with God,
and exercised in his service. But when men are first beginning to
look after God and duty, and are not yet filled and ‘satisfied with the
fatness of his house,’ this temptation hath the greater force upon them,
and they are apt to be discouraged thereby.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He endeavours to discourage them, from <i>the want
of success in the duties of worship</i>. When they have waited long
and sought the Lord, then he puts them upon resolves of declining
any further prosecution, as he did with Joram at the siege of
Samaria; ‘Why wait I upon the Lord any longer?’ 2 Kings vi. 33,
said he, after he had expected deliverance a long time without any
appearance of help. When Saul saw that God ‘answered him not,
neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets,’ 1 Sam. xxviii. 6, 7,
the devil easily persuaded him to leave off the ordinary ways of attendance
upon God, and to consult with the witch of Endor. The profane
persons mentioned in Mal. iii. 14, that had cast off all regard to his
laws, all respect to his ordinances, were brought to this pitch of
iniquity by the suggestions of want of success; they said, ‘It is vain to
serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and
that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?’ It seems
they were like the people spoken of in Isa. lviii. 2, 3: they had fasted
and prayed, and God delayed to answer them, which they looked upon
as a disobligement from duty, and that which they could peremptorily
insist upon as a reason which might justify their neglect. ‘Wherefore
have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we
afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?’ Neither doth this
discouragement fall heavy only upon those whose hearts are departed
already from God, who might be supposed to be forward to embrace
any excuse from his service; but we shall find it bears hard upon the
children of God. David was ready to give over all, as a man forsaken
of God: Ps. xxii. 1, 2, ‘Why hast thou forsaken me? O my God, I
cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season,
and am not silent.’ We may clearly gather from his expressions that
this temptation had sorely bruised him, and that upon God’s delay of
answer, he was ready to charge an unrighteousness upon God’s carriage
toward him; for in that he adds that he kept his ground, and did not
consent to it—as the words following, ‘But thou continuest holy,’ do
imply—it shewed what the devil was objecting to him. And else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>where,
in Ps. lxix. 3, when he had cried and was not answered, he
began to be ‘weary, and his eyes failed; nay, his flesh and heart
failed;’ his spirit sunk, as a man almost vanquished and overcome
with the temptation.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, This our adversary raiseth up discouragements to us
from <i>the unsuitableness of our hearts to our services</i>. Herein he
endeavours to deaden our hearts, to clog our spirits, to hinder and
molest us, and then he improves these indispositions and discomposures
against the duty, in which he hath a double advantage; for (1.) He
deprives us of that delight in duty which should whet on our desires
to undertake it, so that we come to the Lord’s table as old Barzillai,
without a taste or relish of what we eat or drink. When we come to
hear, ‘the ear that trieth words,’ as the palate tasteth meat, finds no
savour in what is spoken; and this Satan can easily do by the inward
deadness or disquiet of the heart, even as the anguish of diseases takes
away all pleasures which the choicest dainties afford; as Job observes,
‘When a man is chastened with pain upon his bed, his life abhors
bread, and his soul dainty meat,’ chap. xxxiii. 20. And when a man
is brought to loathe his duties, as having nothing of that sweetness
and satisfaction in them which is everywhere spoken of, a small temptation
may put him upon neglect of them. (2.) He hath plausible
and colourable arguments by which he formeth an opinion in the
minds of men, that in cases of indisposition they may do better to forbear
than to proceed. He tells them they ought not to pray or present
any service while they are so indisposed, that no prayer is acceptable
where the Spirit doth not enliven the heart and raise the affections;
that they do but take his name in vain, and increase their sin, and that
they should wait till the Spirit fill their sails: and to say the truth, it
is a great difficulty for a child of God to hold his feet in such slippery
places. How many have I known complaining of this, and persuading
themselves verily that they might do far better to leave off all service
than to perform them thus! And scarcely have I restrained them from
a compliance with Satan, by telling them that indispositions are no
bar to duty, but that duty is the way to get our indispositions cured;
that duty is absolutely required, and dispositions to be endeavoured;
and that it is a less offence to keep to duty under indispositions, than
wholly upon that pretence to neglect it; and indeed, where these indispositions
are bemoaned and striven with, the services are often more
acceptable to God than pleasing to ourselves. The principle is truly
spiritual and excellent, a foundation of sapphires and precious stones,
upon which, if we patiently wait, he will build a palace of silver; for
that service is more spiritual that is bottomed and carried on by a conscientious
regard to a command, when there are no moral motives
from sense and comfort concurring, than that which hath more of
delight to encourage it, while the power of the command is less swaying
and influential.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Men are oft discouraged from <i>a sense of unworthiness
of the privilege of duty, a kind of excess of humility</i>, which principally
relates to the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, and prayer. The accuser
of the brethren tells them that they have nothing to do to take the
name of God in their mouths; that it is an insufferable presumption.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Hence some, like the woman with the bloody issue, dare not come to
Christ to ask a cure, while yet they earnestly desire it, and would
rather, if they could, privately steal it than openly beg it. The publican
[Luke xviii. 10, <i>seq.</i>] is presented to us in the parable as one that
could scarce get over that objection. He is set forth standing at a
‘distance, not daring to lift up his eyes to heaven;’ scarce attempting
to speak, rather expressing his unworthiness to pray, than setting upon
the duty; his ‘smiting upon his breast,’ and saying, ‘God be merciful
to me a sinner,’ argued that much of these discouragements lay upon
him. The like we may see in the prodigal, who it seems had it long
in dispute whether he should go to his father, whose kindness he had
so abused; and so long as he could make any other shift he yielded to
the temptation: at last he came to that resolve, ‘I will arise and go
to my father, and say, I have sinned against heaven, and thee, and am
not worthy to be called thy son.’ Which shew that the sense of this
kept him off till necessity forced him over it. And this is a discouragement
the more likely to prevail for a neglect of service, because
part of it is necessary, as the beginning of those convictions of our
folly: to have such low thoughts of ourselves that we are not worthy
to come into his presence, nor to look toward him, is very becoming;
but to think that we should not come to him because our conscience
accuseth of unworthiness, is a conclusion of Satan’s making, and such
as God never intended from the premises, but the direct contrary.
Come, saith God, though unworthy. The like course doth the devil
take to keep men off from the Lord’s table. Oh, saith he, it is a very
solemn ordinance; he that partaketh of it unworthily, eateth and
drinketh damnation to himself. How darest thou make such bold approaches?
While the hearts of men are tender, their consciences
quick and accusing, the threatening begets a fear, and they are
driven off long, and debar themselves unnecessarily from their
mercies.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, Satan endeavours to hinder duty by bringing them
into <i>a dislike and loathing of duty</i>. This is a course most effectual.
Dislike easily bringeth forth aversation, and withal doth strongly fix
the mind in purposes of neglect and refusal. The devil bringeth this
about many ways; as,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>By reproaches and ignominious terms</i>. It was an old
trick of the wicked one to raise up nicknames and scoffs against the
ways of God’s service, thereby to beget an odium in the hearts of men
against them. ‘The seat of the scornful’ is a chair that Satan had
reared up from the beginning. By this art—when ‘God was known
in Jewry, and his name was great in Israel’—were the heathens kept
off from laying hold on the covenant of God. He rendered them and
the ordinances of worship ridiculous to the nations. The opprobrium
of circumcision, and their unreasonable faith, as the heathens thought
it, upon things not seen, was a proverb in every man’s mouth, <i>Credat
Judœus Apella—non ego</i>.<a id="FNanchor_201_201" href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> The Jews were slandered with the yearly
sacrifice of a Grecian. And Apion affirms that Antiochus found such
a one in a bed in the temple; and that they worshipped an ass’s
head in the temple. Apion slandered the Jews with ulcers in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
privy parts every seventh day; hence he derives <i>sabbath</i>, of <i>sabatosis</i>,
which with the Egyptians signifies an ulcer.<a id="FNanchor_202_202" href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>Lysimachus slandered the Jews in Egypt as leprous church-robbers;
and that their city was hence called <i>Hierosola</i>.<a id="FNanchor_203_203" href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> When the Gentiles
were called into the fellowship of the gospel, it was aspersed with
the like scoffs and flouts. It was frequently called a sect, a babbling
and strange and uncouth doctrine, Acts xxviii. 22; besides a great
many lies and forgeries that were invented to make it seem odious; and
by this means it was ‘everywhere spoken against,’ Acts xvii. 18, 20.
Machiavel, that propounded the policy of full and violent calumniations
to render an adversary odious, knowing that how unjust soever
they were, yet some impression of jealousy and suspicion would
remain, had learned it of this old accuser, who had often and long
experienced it to be a prevalent course, to bring the services of God
under dislike, <i>Calumniare fortiter; aliquid adhœrebit</i>. David, speaking
of what befell himself in this kind, Ps. lxix. 9-12, that his zeal lay
under reproach; his weeping and fasting became a proverb; and that
in all these he was ‘the song of the drunkard,’ he expresseth such
apprehensions of the power of this temptation upon the weak, that he
doth earnestly beg that Satan might not make it a snare to them: ver.
6, ‘Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed
for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake.’
And further declares it, as a wonderful preservation and escape of this
danger, that notwithstanding these reproaches, he had not declined
his duty: ver. 13, ‘But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, Lord.’
Paul seems to speak his sense of this piece of policy; his imprisonment
administered matter of reproach to his profession. Though his
cause were good, yet he suffered trouble as ‘an evil-doer,’ 2 Tim. ii. 9.
This he knew the devil would improve to a shame and disgrace unto
the service of God, and therefore he chargeth Timothy to be aware of
that temptation: 2 Tim. i. 8, ‘Be not thou therefore ashamed of the
testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner.’ And ver. 16, he
takes notice of Onesiphorus, that had escaped that snare, and was not
‘ashamed of his chain.’ And we have the greater reason to fear the
danger of this art, when we find that the tempter made use of it
to turn away the affections of the Capernaumites from Christ himself:
Mat. xiii. 57, when he had preached in their synagogues to the
applause and astonishment of all his hearers, the devil, fearing the prevalency
of his doctrine, finds out this shift to bring them to a dislike
of him and his preaching: ‘Is not this the carpenter’s son? And they
were offended in him.’</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Duties are brought under dislike <i>by the hazards that
attend them</i>. The devil leaves it not untold what men shall meet with
from the world if they ‘run not with them into excess of vanity’ and
neglect. If bonds, imprisonments, banishments, hatreds, oppositions,
spoiling of goods, sufferings of all kinds will divert them, he is sure to
set all these affrightments before them; which though they do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
move some from their steadfastness—such as Daniel, whose constancy
in duty was not pierced by the fear of lions; and the three children,
who would not decline the ways of the Lord for the terror of a fiery
furnace—yet these considerations prevail with most; as Christ notes,
in those that received seed in stony places, whose joy in the word was
soon blasted, and they offended at the ways of duty, ‘when tribulation
and persecution because of the word arose,’ Mat. xiii. 21. Christ
pronouncing him blessed that should ‘not be offended in him,’
because of the dangers of his service, shews that the escape of such a
temptation is not a common mercy, Mat. xi. 6. And if we shall observe
Paul’s practice upon his first undertaking of the ministry, when ‘it
pleased God to call him to preach his Son Christ among the heathen,’
Gal. i. 16, we shall see, (1.) That he was aware of such objections as
these; (2.) That flesh and blood are apt to comply with them, and to
take notice of them; (3.) And that the best way to avoid them is to
stop the ears against them, and not to hearken to them or consult
with them; (4.) And that he that must do it to purpose, must, without
delay, immediately resolve against such hindrances; it being most
difficult for men that will be inclining to such motions, and hearkening
to what the devil offers, under pretence of self-preservation, to disengage
themselves after they have suffered their souls to take the
impression.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>The meanness of religious appointments, as to the
outward view, is also made use of to beget a loathing of them</i>. In
this the devil hath this advantage, that however they are all ‘glorious
within,’ and ‘as the curtains of Solomon,’ yet are they, as to their
outward appearance, like ‘the tents of Kedar,’ without any of that
pomp and splendour which the sons of men affect and admire. Christ
himself, when he had veiled his glory by our flesh, was of no exterior
‘form or beauty.’ The ministration of his word, which is ‘the
sceptre of his kingdom,’ seems contemptible, and a very ‘foolishness
to men;’ insomuch that Paul was forced to make an apology for it, in
that it wanted those outward braveries of ‘excellency of speech and
wisdom,’ by shewing it was ‘glorious in its power,’ and was indeed a
‘hidden wisdom’—though not like that ‘wisdom which the princes of
wisdom’ and philosophy affected—‘among such as were perfect,’
1 Cor. ii. 1,4, 6. The sacraments, both of the Old and New Testament,
seemed very low and contemptible things to a common eye;
neither need we any other evidence to shew that men are apt to
disrelish them, and to entertain strange thoughts of them upon this
very account, than this, that some raise up batteries against these
ordinances upon this ground, that because they seem low and mean to
them, therefore they think it improbable that God should have indeed
appointed them to be used in the literal sense, or that at best they are
to be used as the first rudiments of Christianity, and not enjoined
upon the more grown Christians. Neither may I altogether pass over
that remarkable humour that is in some, to give additional ornaments
of outward garb and form for the greater honour and lustre of these
injunctions of Christ; so that while they endeavour to shew their
greatest respects to them, they betray their inward thoughts to have
carried some suspicion of their reality because of their plainness; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
by this means, whilst they endeavour to put an honour upon Christ’s
institutions, they really despise them, and shew their respects to their
own inventions. But that we may be further satisfied that Satan
works by this engine, let us consider that of 1 Cor. i. 23. The Jews
were for signs from heaven to give a credit and testimony to that
doctrine which they would receive. The Greeks, who were then the
only people for learning, were for philosophical speculations and disputes.
Now, saith the apostle, the doctrine of the gospel, which
is the preaching of Christ crucified, because it came not within the
compass of what both these expected, therefore the devil so wrought
upon this advantage, that both contemned it; ‘It was to the Jews
a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness.’ Of this also he
speaks more fully, 2 Cor. xi. 3, where he shews that the minds of the
Corinthians were ready to be corrupted with error against the plain
import of the gospel; and that which they took offence at was its
simplicity. They looked upon it as contemptible, because not containing
such gorgeous things as might suit a soaring and wanton
fancy. Now he resolves all this into a cheat of Satan, taking the
advantage of this, as he did upon Eve from the seeming inconsiderableness
of the prohibition of eating a little fruit, to persuade them
that so mean a thing as the gospel could not be of God. ‘I fear,’
saith he, ‘lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that
is in Christ.’</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>The sins of professors, through the craft of Satan,
beget a loathing of these holy things</i>. If God loathe his own appointments,
and ‘cannot bear them,’ because of the iniquities of those that
offer them, no wonder if men be tempted to disgraceful apprehensions
of them, when they observe some that pretend a high care and deep
respect for them live profanely. The sins of Eli’s sons wrought this
sad effect upon the people, that men, for their sakes, abhorred the
offerings of the Lord, 1 Sam. ii. 17. Those that fell off to error, and
thence to abominable practices, ‘caused the way of truth to be
evil spoken of,’ 2 Pet. ii. 2. The priests that departed out of the
way, ‘caused many to stumble at the law,’ Mal. ii. 8. Nay, so high
doth Satan pursue this sometimes, that it becomes an inlet to direct
atheism.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, Satan also works mightily <i>in the profane dispositions
of men, and acts that principle to a disregard and weariness of the
services of God</i>. A flagitious wicked life naturally leads to it. Those
that ‘eat up God’s people as bread,’ Ps. xiv. 4, ‘called not upon God.’
This eats out at last the very exterior and formal observation of
religious duties. In this Satan bends his force against them, (1.) By
heightening the spirits of men to an insolent defiance of God by
a continued prosperity. He draws out the pride and vanity of their
spirits to a bold contempt: ‘Who is the Lord that we should serve
him? We are lords; we will come no more at thee; our tongues are
our own,’ &amp;c., Jer. ii. 31. Thus they ‘set their mouths against
heaven.’ Eliphaz tells us this, as the usual carriage of those that
lived in peace and jollity: Job xxi. 15, ‘Therefore say they unto
God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
who is the Almighty that we should serve him?’ (2.) By hiding
from them the necessities of duty. Job speaking of the hypocrite, chap.
xxvii. 10, describes him by these neglects of duty, ‘Will he delight
himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?’ Of this he
gives the reason, ver. 9, ‘He will call and cry when trouble comes
upon him.’ When distresses make duties necessary, then he will use
them; in his ‘affliction he will seek him early,’ Hosea v. 15; as the
Israelites did, Ps. lxxviii. 34, ‘When he slew them, then they sought
him, and enquired early after God.’ But when he is not thus
pinched—and Satan will endeavour in this case, that he be as far from
the rod of God as he can make him—he gives over seeking God and
loathes it, nay, accounts it as ridiculous so to do; they ‘mock at his
counsel,’ and contemn his advice of waiting upon him.</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, Satan picks quarrels in men <i>at the manner of performance
of duty</i>. When duty cannot be spoken against, then he
endeavours to destroy it by the modes, circumstances, and way of
performance: as (1.) If those that act in them discover any weakness—as
who doth not, when he hath done his best?—this he endeavours
to blemish the duty withal. The bodily presence of Paul was objected
against him, as being ‘contemptible,’ and his ‘speech as weak,’
[2 Cor. x. 10;] but the design of that objection lay higher, the devil
thereby endeavouring to render the duties of his ministry as contemptible,
and not to be regarded. (2.) If the circumstances please not, he
teacheth them to take pet with the substance, and, like children, to
reject all, because everything is not suitable to their wills. (3.) If it
be managed in any way not grateful to their expectations, if too cuttingly
and plain, then they think they be justified to say they hate it,
as Ahab did Micaiah; if any way too high or abstrusely, then likewise
they fling off. On this point the devil persuaded many of Christ’s
followers to desert him, John vi. 66, because he had spoken of himself
in comparisons that they judged too high. When he said he was that
‘bread that came down from heaven,’ ver. 58, they said ‘that was a
saying not to be borne;’ and on that occasion ‘they went back, and
walked no more with him.’</p>

<p>[7.] Seventhly, The devil brings a nauseating of the duties of worship,
by <i>a wrong representation of them, in the carriage and gestures
of those that engage in them</i>. It seems strange to some that are but
as idle spectators to observe the postures of saints, seriously lifting up
their eyes to heaven, or humbly mourning and smiting on their breasts.
These the devil would render ridiculous, and as the suspicious managements
of an histrionical or hypocritical devotion; as men at a distance
beholding the strange variety of actions and postures of such as dance,
being out of the sound of their music, shall think them a company of
madmen and frantic people. Such perverse prospects doth he sometimes
afford to those that come rather to observe what others do,
than to concern themselves in such duties, that, not seeing their private
influences, nor the secret spring that moves them, they judge them
foolish, and from thence they contract an inward loathing of the duties
themselves.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, In order to the hindering or preventing of duty, Satan
useth to impose upon men <i>by fallacious arguings</i>: and by a piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
his sophistry he endeavours to cheat them out of their services. I
shall note some of his remarkable dealings in this kind: as,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>He heightens the dignity of God’s children, upon a design
to spoil their duty</i>. He tells them they are ‘partakers of the divine
nature,’ [2 Pet. i. 4;] that they are ‘in God and Christ,’ and have the
communications of his Spirit, and therefore they need not now drink
of the cistern, seeing they enjoy the fountain; and that these services,
in their attainments, are as useless as scaffolds are when once the house
is built. To prosecute this he takes advantage, (1.) of the natural
pride of their hearts. He puffs them up with conceits of the excellency
of their condition—a thing which all men are apt to catch at
with greediness upon the least imaginary grounds, 1 Cor. viii. 7; Col.
ii. 18. If a man have but a little knowledge, or have attained to any
vain speculations, he is presently apt to be vainly ‘puffed up by his
fleshly mind.’ The same hazard attends any conceited excellency
which a man apprehends he hath reached unto. Those monsters of
religion, mentioned by Peter and Jude, that made no other use of the
‘grace of God’ but to ‘turn it into wantonness,’ Jude 4; yet were they
so tumefied with the apprehensions of their privileges, that whilst they
designed no other thing than plain licentiousness and a wantonness in
the lusts of the flesh, yet it seems they encouraged themselves and
allured others from a supposed liberty which their privileges gave
them; and to this purpose had frequently in their mouths ‘great
swelling words of vanity,’ 2 Pet. ii. 18, even whilst they ‘walked after
their own lusts,’ Jude 16. (2.) To strengthen their proud conceits,
the devil improves what the Scriptures speak of the differences of
God’s children—that some are spiritual, some are carnal; some weak,
others strong; some perfect, some less perfect; some little children,
some young men, some fathers, 1 Cor. ii. 1; Phil. iii. 15; 1 John ii.
12, 13. The end of all this is to make them apprehend themselves
Christians of a higher rank and order, which also makes way consequently
for a further inference, viz., that there must needs be immunities
and privileges suitable to these heights and attainments. To
this purpose (3.) he produceth those scriptures that are designed by
God to raise up the minds of men to look after the internal work and
power of his ordinances, and not to centre their minds and hopes in
the bare formal use of them, without applying their thoughts to God
and Christ, unto whom they are appointed to lead us. Such as these
scriptures: Rom. ii. 28, ‘He is not a Jew which is one outwardly;
neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he
is a Jew which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart,
in the spirit, and not in the letter.’ And Rom. vi. 7, we should ‘serve
in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.’ 2 Cor. v. 16,
‘Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though
we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
him no more.’ Eph. iv. 13, ‘He gave some apostles, and some prophets,’
&amp;c., ‘for the perfecting of the saints, ... till we all come
in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
unto a perfect man.’ By a perverse interpretation of these, and some
other scriptures of like import, he would persuade them that the great
thing that Christ designed by his ordinances was but to ‘train up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
weaker Christians by these rudiments,’ as the A B C to children, to a
more spiritual and immediate way of living upon God; and that these
become altogether useless when Christians have gotten up to any of
these imaginary degrees of a supposed perfection. Enough of this
may be seen in the writings of Saltmarsh, Winstanly, and others, in
the late times. How great a trade Satan drove by such misapprehensions
not long since cannot easily be forgotten; so that God’s
worship did almost lie waste, and in many places ‘the way to Zion
did mourn.’</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He will sometimes confess an <i>equality of privilege
among the children of God, and yet plead an inequality of duty</i>. That
God is as good and strong to us, and that we have all an equal advantage
by Christ, he will readily acknowledge; but then, when we should
propound the diligence of the saints in their services for our pattern,
as of David’s ‘praying seven times a-day,’ Daniel’s three times, Anna’s
serving God with fastings and prayers night and day, &amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_204_204" href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> he tells us
these were extraordinary services, and as it were works of supererogation,
more than the command of God laid upon them. So that we are
not tied to such strictness; and we, being naturally apt to indulge
ourselves in our own ease, are too ready to comply with such delusions.
And by degrees men are thus brought to a confident belief that they
may be good enough, and do as much as is required, though they slacken
their pace, and do not fast, pray, or hear so often as others have done.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Another sophism of his <i>is to heighten one duty, to the
ruin of another</i>. He strives to make an intestine war among the
several parts of the services we owe to God; and from the excellency
of one, to raise up an enmity and undervaluing disregard of another.
Thus would he sever as inconsistent those things that God hath joined
together. As among false teachers, some say, ‘Lo, here is Christ,’ and
others, ‘Lo, he is there;’ so we find Satan dealing with duties. He
puts some upon such high respects to preaching, that, say they, Christ
is to be found here most frequently, rather than in prayer or other
ordinances; others are made to have the like esteem for prayer:
and they affirm in this is Christ especially to be met withal; others
say the like of sacraments or meditation. In all these Satan labours
to beget a dislike and neglect of other services. Thus, in what relates
to the constitution of churches, he endeavours to set up purity of
churches, to the destruction of unity, or unity to the ruin of purity.
A notable example hereof we have in the <i>Euchytæ</i>, a sect of praying
heretics, which arose in the time of Valentinian and Valens, who,
upon the pretence of the commands of Christ and Paul for praying
continually, or without ceasing and fainting, owned no other duty as
necessary; vilifying preaching and sacraments as things at best useless
and unprofitable.<a id="FNanchor_205_205" href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> The like attempts he makes daily upon men,
where though he prevail not so far as to bring some necessary duties
of service into open contempt, yet he carries them into too much secret
neglect and disregard, Luke xviii. 1; 1 Thes. xv. 17.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, He improves the grace of the gospel to infer an
<i>unnecessariness of duty</i>; and this he doth not only from the advantage
of a profane and careless spirit in such as presumptuously expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
heaven, though they mind not the way that leads to it; for with such
it is usual, as one observes,<a id="FNanchor_206_206" href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> for Satan to sever the means from the
end in things that are good; to make them believe they shall have
peace, though they walk in the imaginations of their heart; to make
them lean upon the Lord for heaven, in the apparent neglect of holiness
and duty; as in evil things he severs the end from the means,
making them confident they shall escape hell and condemnation,
though they walk in the path that leads thither. But besides this,
he abuseth the understandings and affections of men by strange and
uncouth inferences; as that God hath received a satisfaction, and
Christ hath done all, so that nothing is left for us to do. The apostle
Paul was so much aware of this kind of arguing, that when he was to
‘magnify the grace of God,’ he always took care to fence against such
perverse reasonings, severely rebuking and refelling such objections:
as in Rom. iii. 7, 8, where speaking that our ‘unrighteousness did
commend the righteousness of God,’ he falls upon that reply, ‘Why
then am I judged as a sinner?’ which he sharply refells, as an inference
of slanderous imputation to the gospel, which hath nothing in it
to give the least countenance to that conclusion, ‘Let us do evil, that
good may come;’ and adds, that damnation shall justly overtake such
as practise accordingly. The like we have, Rom. vi. 1, ‘Shall we
continue in sin, that grace may abound?’ which he rejected with the
greatest abhorrency, ‘God forbid!’ From both which places we
may plainly gather, that as unsound as such arguings are, yet men,
through Satan’s subtlety, are too prone, upon such pretences, to dispute
themselves to a careless neglect of duty. This might be enlarged
in many other instances, as that of Maximus Tyrius, who disputed all
duties unnecessary upon this ground, ‘That what God will give, cannot
be hindered; and what he will not give, cannot be obtained; and
therefore it were needless to seek after anything.’ Much to the same
purpose do many argue, if they be predestinated to salvation, they
shall be saved, though they do never so little; if they be not predestinated,
they shall not be saved, though they do never so much. In
all which inferences the devil proceeds upon a false foundation of severing
the means and the end, which the decree of God hath joined together;
but the main of the design is to hide the necessity of duty
from them.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, By urging a necessity or conveniency for <i>suspending
or remitting duties</i>. In temptations to sin, he doth from a little draw
on the sinner to more; but in omissions of duty he would entice us
from much to little, and from little to nothing. Very busy he is with
us to break or interrupt our constant course of duty. Duties in order
and practice, are like so many pearls upon one string; if the thread be
broken, it may hazard the scattering of all. If we be once put out of
our way, we are in danger to rove far before we be set in our rank
again. To effect this, (1.) he will be sure to straiten or hinder us
in our opportunities if he can, and then to plead necessity for a dispensation.
It is true indeed, necessities, when unavoidable—as the
issue of providence rather than our negligence—may excuse an omission
of duty, because in such cases, God accepting the will for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
deed, will have mercy and not sacrifice. But necessity is most-what<a id="FNanchor_207_207" href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> a
pretence or cover to the slothfulness of professors, and the devil will
do all he can to gratify them in that humour, and to prepare excuses
for them from such hindrances or interruptions as business or disturbances
can make; yet if these be not in readiness, he will (2.)
endeavour to take off our earnestness by suggesting to us our former
diligence, that we at other times have been careful and active; or
(3.) by setting before us the greater negligence of those that are below
us. The meaning of both which insinuations is to this one purpose,
that we may make bold with some omissions, without any great
hazard of our religious intentions, or scandal and offence to others.
Now if he can by any of these ways bring us to any abatement of our
wonted care and exercise, he will then still press for more, and from
fervency of spirit to a cold moderation; from thence he will labour to
bring us down to seldom performances; from thence, to nothing. The
spiritual sluggard that will be overcome to some neglects, shall be
found a companion at last to a waster, Prov. xviii. 9, and will be
brought to a total neglect of all. The church of Ephesus, Rev. ii. 4,
5, may sadly give proof of this; they left their first love, and from
thence declined so far that at last God was provoked to ‘remove the
candlestick out of its place.’</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, Satan puts tricks upon men in order to the hindering
of duty, by putting us from a service <i>presently needful, with the proposal
of another, in which, at that time, we are not so concerned</i>. In
several duties of Christianity there is a great deal of skill required to
make a right choice, for present or first performance; and to have a
right judgment to discover the times and seasons of them, is matter of
necessary study. Our adversary observing our weaknesses in this,
when no other art will prevail, endeavours to put us upon an inconvenient
choice, when he cannot make us neglect all. As (1.) by
engaging us in a less duty, that we may neglect a greater; he is willing
that we, as the Pharisees, should ‘tithe mint and anise,’ upon
condition that we ‘neglect the greater things of the law.’ This was
the fault of Martha, Luke x. 41, who busied herself in making entertainment
for Christ’s welcome, and in the meantime neglected to hear
his preaching: which, as he notes, was the only necessary duty of that
time; ‘one thing’ is necessary. She is not blamed for doing that
which was simply evil in itself—for the thing she did was a duty—but
for not making a right choice of duty; for that rebuke, ‘Mary
hath chosen the better part,’ is only a comparative discommendation;
as Austin interprets, <i>Non tu malam, sed illa meliorem</i>, The thing thou
doest is not evil, if it had not put thee upon a neglect of a greater
good. (2.) He sometimes puts men upon what is good and necessary,
but such as they cannot come at without sin. Thus sacrificing in itself
was a necessary duty; and such was Saul’s condition, that it concerned
him at that time to make his peace with God, and to inquire
his mind. Yet when the devil upon that pretence put him upon
offering a sacrifice, he put him upon no small transgression, 1 Sam.
xiii. 13. The like game Satan sometimes plays with private Christians,
who are persuaded beyond their station and capacity in refer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>ence
to some ordinances of God. (3.) He sometimes puts men
upon dangerous undertakings in pursuit of their fancy, of gaining
an advantage for some service; and so are they turned out of the
way of present obedience, in grasping at opportunities of duty out
of their reach. Saul spared the sheep and oxen of the Amalekites
for sacrifice, 1 Sam. xv. 15, 22, when obedience had been more
acceptable than sacrifice. (4.) There is a further cheat in the
choice of duty, when Satan employs them to provide for duties to
come, to the neglect of duties presently incumbent upon them; whereas
we are more concerned in that which at present is necessary, than
in that which may be so for the future; which is a mistake, like that
of caring for the morrow, while we use not what God puts in our hand
for to-day.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Satan’s second grand design against duties is to spoil them.</i> (1.) <i>In
the manner of undertaking, and how he effects this.</i> (2.) <i>In the
act or performance, by distracting outwardly and inwardly. His
various ways therein, by vitiating the duty itself. How he doth
that.</i> (3.) <i>After performance, the manner thereof.</i></p>


<p>The chief of Satan’s ways for the hindering and preventing of duty
have been noted; what he comes short in this design he next labours
to make up, by spoiling and depraving them: and this he doth endeavour
three ways:—</p>

<p>I. 1. First, By putting us upon services <i>in such a manner as shall
render them unacceptable and displeasing unto God, and unprofitable
to us</i>: as by a careless and rash undertaking of service. We are
commanded to ‘take heed’ to ourselves ‘how we hear’ or pray; and
to ‘watch’ over our hearts, that they be in a fit posture for meeting
with God, because the heart in service is that which God most
looks at, and our services are measured accordingly. If then by a
heedless undertaking we adventure upon them, not keeping our ‘foot
when we go into the house of God,’ Eccles. v. 1, we offer no other than
‘the sacrifice of fools,’ and give occasion to God to complain that we
do but ‘draw near to him with our lips, while our hearts are far from
him.’</p>

<p>2. Secondly, The like spoil of duty is made when we adventure
upon it <i>in our own strength, and not in the strength of Christ</i>. Satan
sees the pride of our heart, and how much our gifts may contribute to
it, and how prone we are to be confident of a right performance of
what we have so often practised before; and therefore doth he more
industriously catch at that advantage to make us forget that our
‘strength is in God,’ and that we cannot come to him acceptably but
by his own power. Christians are often abused this way. When
their strength is to seek, duty is oft perversely set before them, that
they may act as Samson did when his locks were cut, who thought
to ‘shake himself, and to go out as at other times,’ and so fell into
the hands of the Philistines, [Judges xvi 20.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>3. Thirdly, If he can substitute <i>base ends and principles, as motives
to duty, instead of these that God hath commanded</i>, he knows the
service will become stinking and loathsome to God. Fasting, prayers,
alms, preaching, or any other duty may be thus tainted, when they are
performed upon no better grounds than ‘to be seen of men,’ or out
of envy, or to satisfy humour, or when from custom, rather than
conscience. How frequently did the prophets tax the Jews for
this, that they fasted to themselves! and brought forth fruit to
themselves! How severely did Christ condemn the Pharisees upon
the same account! telling them that in hunting the applause of
men, by these devotions, they had got all the reward they were like
to have.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, When we do our services <i>unseasonably</i>, not only the
grace and beauty of them is spoiled; but often are they rendered unprofitable.
There are times to be observed, not only for the right
management of common actions, but also for duties. What is Christian
reproof, if it be not rightly suited to season and opportunity? The
same may be said of other services.</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, Services are spoiled, when men set upon them <i>without
resolutions of leaving their sins</i>. While they come with their ‘idols
in their heart,’ and ‘the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their
face, God will not be inquired of by them,’ Ezek. xiv. 3. He requires
of those that present their services to him, that at least they should not
affront him with direct purposes of continuing in their rebellions
against him; nay, he expects from his servants that look for a blessing
in their duties, that they come with their ‘hearts sprinkled from an
evil conscience, and their bodies washed with pure water,’ Heb. x. 22.
If they come to hear the word, they must ‘lay aside all filthiness, and
superfluity of naughtiness,’ James i. 21; if they pray, they must ‘lift
up pure hands,’ 1 Tim. ii. 8; if they come to the Lord’s Supper, they
must eat that feast ‘with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,’
1 Cor. v. 8. And albeit, he may accept the prayers of those that are
so far convinced of their sins—though they be not yet sanctified—that
they are willing to lay down their weapons, and are touched with a
sense of legal repentance; for thus he heard Ahab, and regarded the
humiliation of Nineveh: yet while men cleave to the love of their
iniquity, and are not upon any terms of parting with their sins, God
will not look to their services, but abhor them. For thus he declares
himself, Isa. i. 11, ‘To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices?
Bring no more vain oblations. I cannot away with them, it
is iniquity, even the solemn meeting,—my soul hateth them, they are
a trouble to me, I am weary to bear them: when you spread forth
your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when you make many
prayers, I will not hear.’ The ground of all this is, that their heart
was no way severed from the purposes of sinning, ‘Your hands are
full of blood,’ ver. 15. Satan knowing this so well, he is willing that
they engage in the services of God, if they will keep up their allegiance
to him, and come with intentions to continue wicked still; for so, while
he cannot prevent the actual performance of duty,—which yet notwithstanding
he had rather do, because he knows not but God may by that
means some time or other rescue these slaves of Satan out of his hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
—he makes their services nothing worth, and renders them abominable
to God.</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, In the manner of undertaking duties are spoiled, when
men have not <i>a submissive ingenuity<a id="FNanchor_208_208" href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> in them, by giving themselves
up to the direction and disposal of the Almighty</i>; but rather
confine and limit God to their wills and desires. Sometimes men by
attempting of services to God, think thereby to engage God to humour
them in their wills and ways. With such a mind did Ahab consult
the prophets about his expedition to Ramoth-Gilead; not so much
seeking God’s mind and counsel for direction, as thinking thereby to
engage God to confirm and comply with his determination. With the
same mind did Johanan and the rest of the people consult the Lord
concerning their going down to Egypt, Jer. xlii. 5. Though they
solemnly protested obedience to what God should say, ‘whether it
were good or evil;’ yet when the return from God suited not with
their desires and resolutions, they denied it to be the command of
God; and found an evasion to free themselves of their engagement,
Jer. xliii. 2. Such dealings as these being the evident undertakings
of a hypocritical heart, must needs render all done upon that score
to be presumptuous temptings of God; no way deserving the name
of service.</p>

<p>II. Secondly, Not only are services thus spoiled in those wrong
grounds and ways of attempting, or setting about them, but in <i>the
very act or performance of them</i>. While they are upon the wheel—as
a potter’s vessel in the prophet—they are often marred; and this Satan
doth two ways. (1.) By disturbing our thoughts, which should be
attentive and fixed upon the service in hand. (2.) By vitiating the
duty itself.</p>

<p>1. First, <i>By distracting or disturbing our thoughts</i>. This is a
usual policy of Satan. Those fowls which came down upon Abraham’s
sacrifice are supposed by learned expositors to signify those means
and ways by which the devil doth disorder and trouble our thoughts
in religious services, Gen. xv. 12. And Christ himself compares the
devil stealing our thoughts from duty, to the ‘fowls of the air,’ that
gather up the seed as soon as it is sown, Mat. xiii. 4. There are many
reasons that may persuade us that this is one of his masterpieces of
policy. As (l.) in that the business of distraction is oft easily done.
Our thoughts do not naturally delight in spiritual things, because of
their depravement; neither can they easily brook to be pent in or
confined so strictly as the nature of such employments doth require;
so that there is a kind of preternatural force upon our thoughts, when
they are religiously employed; which as it is in itself laborious, like
the stopping of a stream, or driving Jordan back, so upon the least
relaxing of the spring, that must bend our thoughts heavenward, they
incline to their natural bend and current; as a stone rolled up a hill,
hath a <i>renitentia</i>, a striving against the hand that forceth it, and when
that force slackens it goes downward. How easily then is it for Satan
to set our thoughts off our work! If we slacken our care never so
little, they recoil and tend to their old bias; and how easy is it for
him to take off our hand, when it is so much in his power to inject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
thoughts and motions into our hearts, or to present objects to our
eyes, or sounds to our ears, which by a natural force raiseth up our
apprehension to act, for in such cases <i>non possumus non cogitare</i>; we
cannot restrain the act of thinking, and not without great heedfulness
can we restrain the pursuit of those thinkings and imaginations. (2.)
Satan can also do it insensibly. Our distractions or rovings of
thoughts creep and steal upon us silently, we no more know of it
when they begin than when we begin to sleep, or when we begin to
wander in a journey, where oft we do not take ourselves to be out of
the way, till we come to some remarkable turning. (3.) And when
he prevails to divide our thoughts from our duty, he always makes
great advantage, for thus he hinders at least the comfort and profit of
ordinances. While we are busied to look to our hearts, much of the
duty goeth by, and we are but as those that in public assemblies are
employed to see to the order and silence of others, who can be scarce
at leisure to attend for their own advantage. Besides, much of the
sweetness of ordinances are abated by the very trouble of our attendance.
When we are put to it, as Abraham was, to be still driving away
those fowls that come down upon our sacrifice, the very toil will eat
out and eclipse much of the comfort. Thus also he at least provides
matter to object against the sincerity of the servants of God; and will
assuredly find a time to set it home upon them to the purpose, that
their hearts were wandering in their services. Thus he further gets
advantage for a temptation to leave off their duty, and will not cease
to improve such distractions as we have heard to an utter overthrow
of their services. Nay, if he prevail to give us such distractions as
wholly takes away our minds and serious attentions from the service,
then is the service become nothing worth, though the outward circumstances
of attendance be never so exact and saint-like. Who could
appear in a more religious dress than those in Ezek. xxxiii. 31, who
came and sat, and were pleased with divine services, as to all outward
discovery, as God’s people; yet was all spoiled with this, that their
hearts were after their covetousness?</p>

<p>Now this distraction Satan can work two ways.</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>By outward disturbances</i>. He can present objects to
the eyes on purpose to entice our thoughts after them. The closing of
the eyes in prayer is used by some of the servants of God to prevent
Satan’s temptations this way. And we find, in the story of Mr Rothwel,
that the devil took notice of this in him, that he ‘shut his eyes
to avoid distraction in prayer;’<a id="FNanchor_209_209" href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> which implies a concession in the
devil, that by outward objects he useth to endeavour our distraction in
services. The like he doth by noises and sounds. Neither can we
discover how much of these disturbances, by coughings, hemmings,
tramplings, &amp;c., which we hear in greater assemblies, are from Satan,
by stirring up others to such noises. We are sure the damsel that
had an unclean spirit, Acts xvi., that grieved and troubled Paul, going
about these duties with her clamours, was set on by that spirit within
her, to distract and call off their thoughts from the services which
they were about to undertake. Besides the common ways of giving
trouble to the servants of God in outward disturbances, he sometimes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
though rarely, doth it in an extraordinary manner; thus he endeavoured
to hinder Mr Rothwel from praying for a possessed person, by
rage and blaspheming. The like hindrance we read he gave Luther
and others; and truly so strict an attendance in the exercise of our
minds, spiritual senses and graces, is required in matters of worship,
and so weak are our hearts in making a resistance or beating off these
assaults, that a very small matter will discompose us, and a smaller
discomposure will prejudice and blemish the duty.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, He distracts or disturbs us also <i>by inward workings,
and injections of motions, and representations of things to our minds</i>:
and as this is his most general and usual way, so doth he make use of
greater variety of contrivance and art in it. As,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>By the troublesome impetuousness and violence of his injections,
they come upon us as thick as hail</i>. No sooner do we put by
one motion but another is in upon us. He hath his quiver full of
these arrows, and our hearts, under any service, swarm with them; we
are incessantly infested by them and have no rest. At other times,
when we are upon worldly business, we may observe a great ease and
freedom in our thoughts; neither doth he so much press upon us; but
in these Satan is continually knocking at our door, and calling to us,
so that it is a great hazard that some or other of these injections may
stick upon our thoughts, and lead us out of the way; or if they do
not, yet it is a great molestation or toil to us.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He can so order his dealings with us, that he provokes
us sometimes <i>to follow him out of the camp, and seeks to ensnare
us by improving our own spiritual resolution and hatred against him</i>;
even as courage, whetted on and enraged, makes a man venture some
beyond the due bounds of prudence or safety. To this end he sometimes
casts into our thoughts hideous, blasphemous, and atheistical
suggestions, which do not only amaze us, but oftentimes engage us to
dispute against them, which at such time is all he seeks for; for
whereas in such cases we should send away such thoughts with a short
answer, ‘Get thee behind me, Satan,’ we by taking up the buckler and
sword against them are drawn off from minding our present duty.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, He doth sometimes seek to allure and draw our
thoughts to the object <i>by representing what is pleasant and taking</i>.
(1.) He will adventure to suggest good things impertinently and unseasonably,
as when he puts us upon praying while we should be hearing;
or while we are praying, he puts into our hearts things that we
have heard in preaching. These things, because good in themselves,
we are not so apt to startle at, but give them a more quick welcome.
(2.) He also can allure our thoughts by the strangeness of the things
suggested. Sometimes we shall have hints of things which we knew
not before, or some fine and excellent notions, so that we can scarce
forbear turning aside after them to gaze at them; and yet when all is
done, except we wholly neglect the duty for them, they will so vanish,
that we can scarce remember them when the duty is over. (3.) Sometimes
he suits our desires and inclinations with the remembrances of
things that are at other times much in our love and affection; and
with these we are apt to comply, the pleasure of them making us forget
our present duty. Thoughts of estates, honours, relations, delights,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
recreations, or whatever else we are set upon at other times, will more
easily prevail for audience now.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, He hath a way to betray and circumvent us <i>by
heightening our own jealousies and fears against him</i>; and here he
outshoots us in our own bow, and by a kind of overdoing makes us
undo our desired work. For where he observes us fearful and watchful
against wandering, he doth alarm us the more: so that (1.) instead
of looking to the present part of duty, we reflect upon what is
past, and make inquiries whether we performed that aright, or whether
we did not wander from the beginning. Thus our suspicions that we
have miscarried bring us into a miscarriage: by this are we deceived,
and put off from minding what we are doing at present. Or (2.) an
eager desire to fix our thoughts on our present service doth amaze and
astonish us into a stupid inactivity, or into a saying or doing we know
not what; as ordinarily it happens to persons, that out of a great fearfulness
to offend in the presence of some great personages, become
unable to do anything right, or to behave themselves tolerably well;
or as an oversteady and earnest fixing the eye weakens the sight, and
renders the object less truly discernible to us.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, Sometimes <i>the exercise of fancy acting or working
according to some mistake which we have entertained as to the manner
of performance, doth so hold our thoughts doing, that we embrace a
cloud or shadow when we should have looked after the substance</i>. I
will give an instance of this in reference to prayer, which, I have observed,
hath been a snare and mistake to some, and that is this: because
in that duty the Scripture directs us to go to God, and to set
him before us, therefore have they thought it necessary to frame an
idea of God in their thoughts, as of a person present to whom they
speak. Hence their thoughts are busied to conceive such a representation;
and when the shadow of imagination vanisheth, their thoughts
are again busied to inquire whether their hearts are upon God.
Thus by playing with fancy, they are really less attentive upon their
duty.</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, Satan can lay <i>impressions of distraction upon men before
they come to religious services</i>, which shall then work and shew
their power to disturb and divide our hearts, which is by a strong prepossession
of the heart with anything that we fear, or hope, or desire,
or doth any way trouble us. These will stick to us, and keep us company
in our duties, though we strive to keep them back. And this
was the ground of the apostle’s advice to the unmarried persons, to
continue in single life,—times of persecution and distress nearly approaching,—that
they might ‘attend upon the Lord without distraction,’
1 Cor. vii. 37; implying that the thoughtfulness and more than
ordinary carefulness which would seize upon the minds of persons
under such straits and hazards, would unavoidably follow them in
their duties, and so distract them.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, The other way, besides this of distraction, by which
Satan spoils our duties in the act of performance, is <i>by vitiating duty
itself</i>; and this he commonly doth three ways.</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>When he puts men upon greater care for the outward
garb and dress of a service than for the inward work of it</i>. He en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>deavours
to make some devotionaries deal with their duties, as the
pharisees did with their cups, washing and adorning the outside, while
the inside is altogether neglected. Thus the papists generally are for
the outward pomp and beauty of services, being only careful that all
things should have their external bravery, as the tombs of the prophets
were painted and beautified, which yet were full of rottenness. And
the generality of Christians are more taken up with this than with the
service of the heart. Paul was so sensible of this snare in the work
of preaching, where ordinarily men cared for ‘excellency of speech or
wisdom,’ 1 Cor. ii. 2, that he determines another course of preaching;
not notions, or rhetoric, and enticing words, but the doctrine of Christ
crucified in sincerity and plainness, 1 Cor. ii. 2. It is not indeed the
outward cost and fineness of ordinances that God regards. ‘Incense
from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country,’ Jer. vi. 20, are
not to any purpose where the heart doth not most design a spiritual
service; for these are rather a satisfaction to the humours of men than
to please God: an offering to themselves rather than to him. And
therefore is it, that what Jeremiah confessed they did, (chap. vi. 20,) in
buying incense and the sweet cane, Isaiah (chap, xliii. 24) seems to
deny, ‘Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money’—that is,
though thou didst it, yet it was to thyself, rather than to me: I accepted
it not, and so was it all one as if thou hadst not done it.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Duties and services are more apparently vitiated by
<i>human additions</i>; a thing expressly contrary to the second commandment,
and yet is there a strange boldness in men this way, which
sometimes riseth to such a height, that the plain and clear commands
of God are violated under the specious pretence of decency, order, and
humility; and nothing doth more take them than what they devise
and find out. Satan knows how displeasing this is to God, and how
great an inclination there is in men to be forward in their inventions
and self-devised worship, that he can easily prevail with the incautious.
This was the great miscarriage of the Jewish nation all along
the Old Testament; and of the pharisees, who, though they declined
the idolatries of their fathers, yet were so fond upon their traditions,
that they made their worship vain, as Christ tells them. And this
humour also in Paul’s time was insinuating itself into Christians,
managed by a great deal of deceit [Col. ii. 8] and ‘show of wisdom,’
ver. 23, which accordingly he doth earnestly forewarn them of. There
are indeed several degrees of corrupting a service or ordinance by
human additions, according to which it is more or less defiled: yet
the least presumption this way is an offence and provocation.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Duties are vitiated <i>in their excess</i>. Natural worship,
which consists in fear, love, faith, humility, &amp;c., can never be too
much, but instituted worship may. Men may preach too much, and
pray too long—a fault noticed by Christ in the pharisees; they made
‘long prayers’—Even in duties, a man may be righteous overmuch.
Timothy was so in his great pains and over-abstemious life, to the
wasting of his strength—which the apostle takes notice of, and adviseth
against it, ‘Drink no longer water,’ &amp;c., [1 Tim. v. 23.] The Corinthians
were so, when out of a high detestation of the miscarriage of
the incestuous person, they were backward to forgive him, and to re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>ceive
him into the church again. Peter is another instance to us of
excess, John xiii. 8. First, in a modest humility, he refuseth to let
Christ ‘wash his feet;’ but after understanding the meaning of it, then
he runs to the other extreme, and offers not ‘only his feet, but his
hands and his head.’ When the servants of God are conscious of defects
in their services, as if they would make amends for these by the
length and continuance of their services, they are easily drawn into an
excess every way disadvantageous to themselves and the service.</p>

<p>III. Thirdly, When Satan’s designs do not take to spoil the duties,
either by the manner of the attempt or in the act, he then seeks to
play an after-game, and endeavours to spoil them <i>by some after-miscarriage
of ours in reference to these services</i>. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>When he makes us proud of them</i>. We can scarce perform
any service with a tolerable suitableness, but Satan is at hand to
instil thoughts of applause, vainglory, and boasting: and we readily
begin to think highly of ourselves and performances; as if we were
better than others, whom we are apt to censure as low and weak in
comparison of ourselves. Though this be an apparent deceit, yet it is
a wonder how much the minds, even of the best, are apt to be tainted
with it; even where there are considerable endeavours for humility and
self-denial, these thoughts are apt to get too much entertainment.
Now though we run well, and attain some comfortable strength and
watchfulness in the services of God; yet if they be afterward fly-blown
with pride, or if we think to embalm them with praises, or reserve
them as matter of ostentation; though they be angels’ food, yet, like
the manna of the Israelites when kept too long, they will putrify and
breed worms, and so be good for nothing, after that we have been at
the pains of gathering it.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, When well-performed services are perverted <i>to security</i>,
then are they also spoiled. We are ready to say of them, as the
rich man of his abundance, ‘Soul, take thine ease: thou hast much laid
up for many years,’ [Luke xii. 19.] Satan is willing, for a further
advantage, that we think ourselves secure from him; and as after a
full meal we are apt to grow drowsy, so after services we are apt to
think ourselves out of harm’s way. The church after a high feast
with Christ, presently falls asleep, and highly miscarries in security
and neglect, Cant. v. 2. By this means do the best of saints sometimes
lose the things they have wrought, and throw down what they
formerly built up.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_I_2">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>That it is Satan’s grand design to corrupt the minds of men with
error—The evidences that it is so—And the reasons of his endeavours
that way.</i></p>


<p>Next to Satan’s deceits in tempting to sin and against duty, his
design of <i>corrupting the minds of men by error</i> calls for our search;
and indeed this is one of his principal endeavours, which takes up a
considerable part of his time and diligence. He is not only called in
Scripture an ‘unclean spirit,’ but also a ‘lying spirit,’ [1 Kings
xxii. 22,] and there are none of these cursed qualifications that lie
idle in him. As by his uncleanness we may easily conjecture his
attempts upon the will and affections to defile them by lust; so by
his lying we may conclude that he will certainly strive to blind the
understanding by error. But a clear discovery of this we may have
from these considerations:—</p>

<p>I. 1. First, <i>From God’s interest in truth, in reference to his great
designs of holiness and mercy in the world</i>. Truth is a ray and
beam of him who is the Father of lights.<a id="FNanchor_210_210" href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> All revealed truths are
but copies and transcripts of that essential, archetypal truth. Truth
is the rod of his strength, Ps. cx. 2, the sceptre of his kingdom, by
which he doth subdue the hearts of men to his obedience and service
in conversion. Truth is that rock upon which he hath built his
church, the foundations are the prophets and apostles, Eph. ii. 20—that
is, the doctrine of the prophets and apostles, in the Scriptures of
the Old and New Testament. Truth is that great <i>depositum</i> committed
to the care of his church, which is therefore called the pillar
of truth, 1 Tim. iii. 15; because as princes or rulers put their proclamations
on pillars for the better information of their subjects, so
doth his church hold out truth to the world. Holiness is maintained
by truth, our ways are directed by it, and by it are we forewarned of
Satan’s devices, John xvii. 17. Now the prince of darkness carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
himself in as full an opposition to the God of truth as he can in all
his ways, God’s interest in truth will sufficiently discover the devil’s
design to promote error; for such is his hatred of God, that, though
he cannot destroy truth, no more than he can tear the sun out of the
firmament, yet he will endeavour by corrupting the copy to disgrace
the original. Though he cannot break Christ’s sceptre, yet by
raising error he would hinder the increase of his subjects; though he
cannot remove the rock upon which the church is built, he will endeavour
to shake it, or to interrupt the building, and to tear down
God’s proclamation from the pillar on which he hath set it to be read
of all; and if we can conceive what a hatred the thief hath to the
light, as it contradicts and hinders his designs, we may imagine there
is nothing against which the devil will use greater contrivances than
against the light of truth. He neither can nor will make a league
with any, but upon the terms that Nahash propounded to the men of
Jabesh-Gilead—that is, that he may ‘put out their right eye,’ and so
‘lay it for a reproach upon the Israel of God,’ 1 Sam. xi. 3. It is the
work of the Holy Spirit ‘to lead us into truth,’ and by the rule of
contraries it is the devil’s work to lead into error.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, Though the Scripture doth charge the sin and danger
of delusion and error upon those men that promote it to the deception
of themselves and others, yet doth it chiefly blame Satan for <i>the
great contriver of it, and expressly affirms him to be the grand deceiver</i>.
Instruments and engineers he must make use of to do him
service in that work, but still it is the devil that is a lying spirit in
their mouths; it is he that teacheth and prompts them, and therefore
may they be called, as Elymas was by Paul, the children of the
devil, Acts xiii. 10, or, as Cerinthus of old, the first-born of Satan,
πρωτότοκον τοῦ Σατανᾶ.</p>

<p>The church of Corinth, among other distempers, laboured under
dangerous errors, against which when the apostle doth industriously
set himself, he doth chiefly take notice, (1.) Of the false teachers,
who had cunningly wrought them up to an aptitude of declining
from the ‘simplicity of the gospel.’ These he calls false apostles, as
having no commission from God, and Satan’s ministers, 2 Cor. xi.
13, 15; thereby informing us who it is that sends them out and employs
them upon this errand. (2.) He especially accuseth Satan as
the great contriver of all this evil. If any shut their eyes against the
light, he gives this for the principal cause, that ‘the god of the world
blinded their minds,’ 2 Cor. iv. 4. If any stumbled at the simplicity
of the gospel, he presently blames the ‘subtlety of the old serpent’ for
it, 2 Cor. xi. 3. When false doctrine was directly taught, and varnished
over with the glorious pretexts of truth, still he chargeth
Satan with it, ver. 14, ‘No marvel, for Satan himself is transformed
into an angel of light;’ where he doth not only give a reason of the
corrupting or the adulterating the word of God by false apostles, as
vintners do their wines by mixtures; a metaphor which he makes use
of, chap. ii. 17, καπειλεύοντα; that they learned it of Satan, ‘who
abode not in the truth, but was a liar from the beginning;’ but also, he
further points at Satan, to furnish us with a true account of the
ground of that cunning craft which these deceitful workers used,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
while they metamorphosed themselves, by an imitation of the way and
manner, zeal and diligence of the apostles of Christ, they were taught
by one who had exactly learned the art of imitation, and who could,
to all appearance, act to the life the part of an angel of light. And
to take away all objection or wonder, that so many with such seeming
earnestness and zeal should give up themselves to deceive by false
doctrine, he tells us that this hath been the devil’s work from the first
beguiling of Eve, ver. 3, and that as he then made use of a serpent for
his instrument, so ever since in all ages he hath made so often and so
much use of men as his emissaries, that it should now neither seem a
marvel, nor a great matter to see the devil at this work by his agents,
οὐ Θαυμαστόν, οὐ μέγα, ver. 14, 15.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, That this is Satan’s great design, may be further
cleared from <i>the constant course of his endeavours</i>. The parable of
the tares, Mat. xiii. 25, shews that Satan is as busy in sowing tares,
as the master of the field is in sowing wheat. That by tares, not
errors in the abstract, but men are to be understood, is evident from
the parable itself; but that which makes men to be tares is sin and
error; so that, in a complex sense, we are taught how diligent the
devil, who is expressly signified by the enemy, ver. 39, is in that employment:
much of his time hath been taken up that way. ‘There
were false prophets,’ saith Peter, 2 Epist. ii. 1, ‘and there shall be
false teachers; that is, so it was of old, and so it will be to the end.
The shortest abstract of Satan’s acts in this matter would be long
and tedious; judge of the rest by a few instances.</p>

<p>In the apostles’ times how quickly had the devil broached false
doctrine. That it was necessary to be circumcised, was early taught,
Acts xv. 1. In Col. ii. 8, the vain deceit of philosophy, traditions,
and the elements of the world, which were the body of Mosaical
ceremonies, are mentioned as dangerous intrusions; and in ver. 18,
the worshipping of angels, as it seems, was pleaded for, with no small
hazard to the church. The denial of the resurrection is expressly
charged upon some of the Corinthian church, 1 Cor. xv. 12; and that
‘the resurrection is past already,’ 2 Tim. ii. 18, is affirmed to have been
the doctrine of Hymeneus, Philetus, and others. But these are comparatively
little to that gross error of denying Christ, Jude 4, or ‘that
Jesus is the Christ,’ 1 John ii. 22, or ‘Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh,’ 1 John iv. 3, which are branded for antichristian errors, and
were boldly asserted by many false prophets that were then ‘gone out
into the world;’ and to such a height came they at last, that they
taught the lawfulness of ‘committing fornication, and to eat things
offered to idols,’ Rev. ii. 20. All these falsehoods took the boldness
to appear before all the apostles were laid in their graves: and if we
will believe what Austin tells us [<i>De Hæeres.</i>] from Epiphanius and
Eusebius, there were no less than ten sorts of heretical Antichrists in
the apostle John’s days, the Simonians, Menandrians, Saturnalians,
&amp;c. This was an incredible increase of false doctrine in so short a
time, and in the times and preachings of the apostles themselves,
whose power and authority, one would think, might have made Satan
‘fall before them as lightning.’ What progress, then, in this work
of delusion might be expected when they were all removed out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
world! They left, indeed, behind them sad predictions of the power
of delusion in after times: ‘Of yourselves shall men arise, speaking
perverse things.’ ‘After my departing shall grievous wolves enter,‘
&amp;c., Acts xx. 30. ‘The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
times some shall depart from the faith,’ 1 Tim. iv. 1; and Paul,
2 Thes. ii. 3, prophesies of a general apostasy, upon the revealing of
‘the man of sin,’ and the ‘mystery of iniquity,’ and that these should
be ‘perilous times,’ 2 Tim. iii. 1. To the same purpose, John mentions
the coming of the great Antichrist as a thing generally known
and believed, 1 John ii. 18. But before all these, Christ also had
fully forewarned his servants of false Christs, the power and danger of
their delusion, and of the sad revolt from the faith which should be
before his second coming, Mat. xxiv. 24. And as we have heard, so
have we seen; all ages since the apostles can witness that Satan hath
answered the prophecies that were concerning him. What a strange
increase of errors hath been in the world since that time! Irenæus
and Tertullian made catalogues long since; after them Epiphanius
and Eusebius reckoned about eighty heresies; Austin, after them,
brings the number to eighty-eight. Now though there be just
exceptions against the largeness of their catalogues, and that it is
believed by many that there are several branded in their rolls for
heretics that merely suffer upon the account of their name and nation,
for Barbarism, Scythism, Hellenism are mustered in the front; and
others also stand there for very small matters, as the <i>quarto-decimani</i>,
&amp;c., and that some ought altogether to be crossed out of their
books; yet still it will appear that the number of errors is great, and
that all those hard names have this general signification, that the
devil hath made a great stir in the world by error and opinion. Aftertimes
might also be summoned in to speak their evidence, and our own
knowledge and experience might, without any other help, sufficiently
instruct us, if it were needful, of the truth of this, that error is one
of Satan’s great designs.</p>

<p>II. Secondly, Let us next look into <i>the reasons which do so strongly
engage Satan to these endeavours of raising up errors</i>. If we set
these before us, it will not only confirm us in our belief that this is
one of his main employments—for if error yield him so many advantages
for the ruin of men and the dishonour of God, there can be no
doubt of his readiness to promote it. This also may be of use to put
us in mind who it is that is at work behind the curtain, when we
see such things acted upon the stage, and consequently may beget a
cautious suspicion in our minds against his proceedings. The reasons
are such as these:—</p>

<p>1. First, <i>Error is sinful</i>, so that if Satan should be hindered in
his endeavours for any further mischief than the corrupting of any
particular person, yet he will reckon that he hath not altogether lost
his labour. Some errors, that overturn fundamentals of faith, are as
deadly poison, and called expressly ‘damnable’ by the apostle, 2 Pet.
ii. 1. These heresies are by Paul, Gal. v. 20, recounted among ‘the
works of the flesh,’ of which he positively affirms, that ‘they that do
such things cannot inherit the kingdom of God.’ Those that are of a
lower nature, that do not so extremely hazard the soul, can only be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
capable of this apology, that they are less evil; yet as they are oppositions
to truth, propounded in Scripture for our belief and direction,
they cease not to be sins, though they may be greater or less evils,
according to the importance of those truths which they deny, or the
consequences that attend them; and if we go yet a step lower, to the
consideration of those rash and bold assertions about things not clearly
revealed, though they may possibly be true, yet the positiveness of
avouchments and determinations in such cases, where we want sufficient
reason to support what we affirm—as that of the pseudo-Dionysius
for the hierarchy of angels, and some adventurous assertions concerning
God’s secret decrees, and many other things of like nature—are
by the apostle, Col. ii. 18, most severely taxed for an unwarrantable
and unjust presumption, in setting our foot upon God’s right; as if
such men would by violence thrust themselves into that which God
hath reserved for himself—for so much the word intruding—ἐμβατεύειν—imports.
The cause of this he tells us is the arrogancy of corrupt
reason, the fleshly mind—suitable to that expression, Mat. xvi. 17,
‘Flesh and blood hath not revealed it.’ The bottom of it is pride, which
swells men to this height; and the fruit, after all these swelling
attempts, is no other than as the apples of Sodom, dust and vanity,
‘intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up
by his fleshly mind.’ If then Satan do but gain this, that by error,
though not diffused further than the breast of the infected party,
truth is denied, or that the heart be swelled into pride and arrogancy,
or that he hath hope so to prevail, it is enough to encourage his
attempts.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, But error is a sin <i>of an increasing nature, and
usually stops not at one or two falsehoods, but is apt to spawn into
many others</i>—as some of the most noxious creatures have the most
numerous broods; for one error hath this mischievous danger in it,
that it taints the mind to an instability in every truth; and the bond
of steadfastness being once broken, a man hath no certainty where he
shall stay: as a wanton horse, once turned loose, may wander far. This
hazard is made a serious warning against error: 2 Pet. iii. 17, ‘Beware
lest ye, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your
own steadfastness.’ One error admitted, makes the heart unsteady;
and besides this inconvenience, error doth unavoidably branch itself
naturally into many more, as inferences and conclusions resulting
from it, as circles in water multiply themselves. Grant but one
absurdity, and many will follow upon it, so that it is a miracle to
find a single error.<a id="FNanchor_211_211" href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> These locusts go forth by bands, as the experience
of all ages doth testify, and besides the immediate consequences
of an error, which receive life and being together with itself, as twins
of the same birth, we may observe a tendency in errors, to others
that are more remote, and by the long stretch of multiplied inferences,
those things are coupled together that are not very contiguous. If
the Lutherans—it is<a id="FNanchor_212_212" href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> Dr Prideaux his observation—admit universal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
grace, the Huberians introduce universal election, the Puccians
natural faith, the Naturalists explode Christ and Scriptures at last
as unnecessary. This is then a fair mark for the devil to aim at;
if he prevails for one error, it is a hundred to one but he prevails
for more.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, Satan hath yet a further reach in promoting error, he
knows <i>it is a plague that usually infects all round about</i>; and therefore
doth he the rather labour in this work, because he hopes thereby to
corrupt others, and infected persons are commonly the most busy agents,
even to the ‘compassing of sea and land to gain proselytes’ to their
false persuasions. This harvest of Satan’s labour is often noted in
Scripture. ‘They shall deceive many,’ Mat. xxiv. 24; ‘Many shall
follow their pernicious ways,’ 2 Pet. ii. 2. How quickly had this
leaven spread itself in the church of Galatia, even to Paul’s wonder!
Gal. i. 6, ‘I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that
called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel.’ Instances
of the spreading of error are frequent. Pelagianism rose about the
year 415, but presently spread itself in Palestine, Africa, Greece,
Italy, Sicily, France, and Britain. Arianism, like fire in straw, in a
little time brought its flame over the Christian world, and left her
wondering at herself that she was so suddenly become Arian. Socinianism
had the like prevalency; Lælius privately had sowed the
seeds, and after his death, Faustus Socinus, his nephew, did so bestir
himself, that within ten years after his confident appearing, whole
congregations in Sarmatia submitted themselves to his dictates, as
Calovius affirms,<a id="FNanchor_213_213" href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> and within twenty or thirty years more several
hundreds of churches in Transylvania were infected, and within a
few years more the whole synod was brought over to subscribe to
Socinianism. We have also instances nearer home. After the
Reformation, in the reign of Edward VI., how soon did popery return
in its full strength when Queen Mary came to the crown! which
occasioned Peter Martyr, when he saw young students flocking to
mass, to say, ‘that the tolling of the bell overturned all his doctrine
at Oxford,’ <i>Hæc una notula omnem meam doctrinam evertit</i>. And of
late we have had the sad experience of the power of error to infect.
No error so absurd, ridiculous, or blasphemous, but, once broached, it
presently gained considerable numbers to entertain it.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, Error is also eminently serviceable to Satan for the
bringing in <i>divisions, schisms, rents, hatreds, heart-burnings, animosities,
revilings, contentions, tumults, wars, and whatsoever bitter
fruits, breach of love, and the malignity of hatred can possibly produce</i>.
Enough of this might be seen in the church of Corinth. The divisions
that were amongst themselves were occasioned by it, and a great
number of evils the apostle suspected to have been already produced
from thence, as debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings,
swellings, tumults, 2 Cor. xii. 20. He himself escaped not from
being evilly entreated by those among them that were turned from
the simplicity of the gospel. The quarrelsome exceptions that they
had raised against him he takes notice of. They charged him with
levity, in neglecting his promise to come to them, 2 Cor. i. 17. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
called him carnal, one that walked according to the flesh, chap. x. 2:
they taunted him as a contemptible fellow, ver. 10. They undervalued
his ministry, which occasioned, not without great apology, a
commendation of himself; nay, they seemed to call him a false apostle,
and were so bold as to challenge him for a proof of Christ speaking
in him, 2 Cor. xiii. 3.</p>

<p>If the devil had so much advantage from error that was but in the
bud, and that in one church only, what may we imagine hath he done
by it, when it broke out to an open flame in several churches! What
work do we see in families when an error creeps in among them!
The father riseth up against the son, the son against the father, the
mother against the daughter, the daughter against the mother.
What sad divided congregations have we seen! what fierceness, prejudices,
slanders, evil surmises, censurings, and divisions hath this
brought forth! what bandying of parties against parties, church
against church, hath been produced by this engine! How sadly
hath this poor island felt the smart of it! The bitter contests that
have been betwixt presbyterian and independent, betwixt them and
the episcopal, makes them look more like factious combinations, than
churches of Christ. The present differences betwixt conformists and
nonconformists, if we take them where they are lowest, they do daily
produce such effects as must needs be very pleasing and grateful to
the devil, both parties mutually objecting schism, and charging each
other with crime and folly. What invectives and railings may be
heard in all companies, as if they had been at the greatest distances
in point of doctrine! But whosoever loseth, to be sure the devil gains
by it. Hatreds, strife, variance, emulations, lyings, railings, scorn,
and contempt, are all against the known duty of brotherly kindness,
and are undoubted provocations against the God of love and peace.
What can we then think of that can be so useful to Satan as error,
when these above-mentioned evils are the inseparable products of it?
The modestest errors that ever were among good men are still accompanied
with something of these bitter fruits. The differences about
meats and days, when managed with the greatest moderation, made
the strong to despise the weak as silly, wilful, factious humorists;
and, on the contrary, the weak judged the strong as profane, careless,
and bold despisers of divine institutions; for so much the apostle
implies, Rom. xiv. 3, ‘Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth
not; and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth.’ But
should we trace error through the ruins of churches, and view the
slaughters and bloodshed that it hath occasioned, or consider the
wars and desolations that it hath brought forth, we might heap up
matter fit for tears and lamentations, and make you cease to wonder
that Satan should so much concern himself to promote it.</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, The greatest and most successful stratagem for the
hindering a reformation, is that of <i>raising up an army of errors</i>.
Reformation of abuses, and corruptions in worship or doctrine, we
may well suppose the devil will withstand with his utmost might and
policy, because it endeavours to pull that down which cost him so much
labour and time to set up, and so crosseth his end. They who are
called out by God to ‘jeopard their lives in the high places of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
field,’ Judges v. 18, undertake a hard task in endeavouring to check
the power of the mighty, whose interest it is to maintain those defilements
which their policy hath introduced, to fix them in the possession
of that grandeur and command which so highly gratifies their
humours, and self-seeking aspiring minds. But Satan knowing the
strength of that power which hath raised them up to oppose, with
spiritual resolution, the current of prevailing iniquity, usually provides
himself with this reserve, and comes upon their backs with a party of
deluded, erroneous men, raised up from among themselves, and by this
means he hopes either to discourage the undertakers for reformation,
by the difficulty of their work, which must needs drive on heavily
when they that should assist prove hinderers, or at least to straiten
and limit the success; for by this means, (1.) He divides the party,
and so weakens their hands. (2.) He strengthens their enemies, who
not only gather heart from these divisions, seeing them so fair a prognostic
of their ruin, but also improve them, by retorting them as an
argument, that they are all out of the way of truth. (3.) The erroneous
party in the rear of the reformers do more gall them with their arrows,
even bitter words of cursed reviling, and more hazard them with their
swords and spears of opposition, than their adversaries in the front
against whom they went forth. In the meanwhile, they that stand up
for truth are as corn betwixt two millstones—oppressed with a double
conflict, beset before and behind.</p>

<p>This hath been Satan’s method in all ages. And indeed policy
itself could not contrive anything that would more certainly obstruct
reformation than this. When the apostles, who in these last days were
first sent forth, were employed to reform the world, to throw down the
ceremonies of the Old Testament and heathen worship, Satan had presently
raised up men of corrupt minds to hinder their progress. What
work these made for Paul at Corinth, and with the Galatians, the
epistles to those churches do testify. The business of these men was
to draw disciples after them from the simplicity of the gospel, nay, to
another gospel; and this they could not do but by setting up themselves,
boasting of the Spirit, carrying themselves as the apostles of
Christ, and contemning those that were really so, insinuating thereby
into the affections of the seduced, as if they zealously affected them,
and that Paul was but ‘weak and contemptible,’ nay, their very ‘enemy,
for telling them the truth,’ [Gal. iv. 16.] What unspeakable hindrance
must this be to Paul! What grief of heart, what fear and jealousy
must this produce! He professeth he was afraid lest he had ‘bestowed
upon them labour in vain,’ Gal. iv. 11; and that he did no less than
‘travail of them in birth the second time,’ ver. 19. If one Alexander
could do Paul so much evil by ‘withstanding his words,’ that he complains
of him, and cautions Timothy against him, 2 Tim. iv. 24; if
one Diotrephes, by ‘prating against John with malicious words,’ prevailed
with the church, that they ‘received him not, nor the brethren,’
3 John 10, what hurt might a multitude of such be able to do!</p>

<p>In the primitive times of the church, after the apostles’ days, when
those worthies were to contest with the heathen world, the serpent
‘cast out of his mouth water, as a flood, after the woman,’—which most
interpret to be a deluge of heresies, and some particularly understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
it of the Arian heresy,—that he might hinder the progress of the gospel;
which design of his did so take, that many complaints there were of
hindering the conversion of the heathens, by the errors that were among
Christians. Epiphanius tells us that pagans refused to come near the
Christians, and would not so much as hear them speak, being affrighted
by the wicked practices and ways of the Priscillianists. Austin complains
to the same purpose, that loose and lascivious heretics administered
matter of blaspheming to the idolatrous heathens.</p>

<p>In after-times, when religion grew so corrupt by popery, that God
extraordinarily raised up Luther, Calvin, and others in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, to discover those abominations, and to bring
back his people from Babylon, the devil gave them no small trouble
by a growth of errors, so that they were forced to fight against the
papists before and those Philistines behind; insomuch that reformation
attained not that height and universality which might rationally
have been expected from such blessed undertakings. This was the
conjecture of many, particularly of our countryman Dr Prideaux,<a id="FNanchor_214_214" href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> that
if these fanatic enthusiasts, which with so great a scandal to the gospel
then brake forth, had not retarded and hindered those glorious proceedings,
that apocalyptical beast of Rome had been not only weakened
and wounded, but utterly overthrown and slain. In particular cities,
where any of the faithful servants of Christ endeavoured to detect the
errors of popery, these instruments of Satan were ready to join with
the common adversary in reproaches and disturbances. How they
opposed Musculus at Augusta, and with what fierceness they called
him viper, false prophet, wolf in sheep’s clothing, &amp;c., you may see in
those that write his life. How these men hindered the gospel at Limburg
against Junius, at Zurich against Zuinglius, at Augsburg against
Urbanus Regius, you may also see in their lives.<a id="FNanchor_215_215" href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> In all which, and
others of like nature, you will still find, (1.) That there was never a
reformation begun, but there were erroneous persons to hinder and
distract the reformers; (2.) That these men expressed as great hatred
against the reformers, and oftentimes more, than against the papists;
and were as spitefully bitter in lies, slanders, and scorns against them,
as the papists themselves.</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, Satan can also make use of error either to <i>fix men in
their present mistaken ways and careless course, or as a temptation to
atheism</i>. Varieties of opinions and doctrines do amuse and amaze
men. While one cries, ‘Lo, here is Christ,’ and another, ‘Lo, he is
here,’ men are so confounded that they do not know what to choose.
It is one of the greatest difficulties to single out truth from a crowd of
specious, confident pretences, especially seeing truth is modest, and
oftentimes out-noised by clamorous, bold error; yea, sometimes out-vied
by the pretensions of spirit and revelation in an antiscriptural
falsehood. At what a loss is an unskilful traveller where so many
waves<a id="FNanchor_216_216" href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> meet! While one party cries up this, another that, mutually
charging one another with error, they whose hearts are anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
loosened from a sense and reverence of religion, are easily tempted to
disbelieve all. Thus error leads to atheism, and lays the foundation
for all those slanderous exceptions against Scripture by which godless
men usually justify themselves in their religion. Now though all
wicked men are not brought to this, because the consciences of some
do so strongly retain the sentiments of a deity, that all Satan’s art
cannot obliterate those characters; yet the consideration of the multitude
of errors doth rivet them in the persuasion of the truth and goodness
of that way of religion wherein they had been educated. Papists
are hardened by this; and though they have no reason to boast of
their unity among themselves, as they have been often told, and now
of late by Dr Stillingfleet,<a id="FNanchor_217_217" href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> who hath manifested that their divisions
among themselves are as great, and managed with as great animosity,
as any amongst us; yet are their ears so beaten with the objection of
sects and schisms elsewhere, that they are generally confirmed to stay
where they are. Besides, this is a stumbling-block which the devil
throws in the way of poor ignorant people. If they are urged to a
serious strictness in religion, they are affrighted from it by the consideration
of sects and parties, and the woeful miscarriages of some
erroneous persons that at first pretended to strictness, imagining that
strictness in religion is an unnecessary, dangerous thing, and that the
sober, godly Christians are but a company of giddy, unsettled, conceited,
precise persons, who will in a little time run themselves into
madness and distraction, or into despair. And thus out of fear of
schism or error, they dare not be religious in good earnest; but content
themselves with ‘drawing near to God with their mouths, and
confessing him with their lips, whilst their hearts are far from him, and
in their works they deny him,’ [Titus i. 16.]</p>

<p>There is such a propensity in the hearts of men to be staggered by
the multitude and boldness of errors, that the apostle Paul expresseth
a sense of it, and seems tenderly careful to avoid that blow, which he
knew Satan would readily give through that consideration, by the
apology that he makes for God in his holy, wise, providential permission
of them, 1 Cor. xi. 19, ‘There must be heresies among you.’
His intent is not barely to put them off with this, that heresies are
unavoidable, but to satisfy them that there is a necessity of them, and
that they are useful, as God’s furnace and fan, to purify and to cleanse,
that ‘they which are approved may be made manifest.’ The like
care he hath in 2 Tim. ii. 19, 20, upon the mention of the error of
Hymeneus and Philetus, where he obviateth the offence that might
arise by reason of their apostasy, partly by removing the fears of the
upright, in affirming their safety whatever became of other men, seeing
‘the foundation of God standeth sure,’ and partly by declaring it no
more suitable or dishonourable for God to permit the rise of errors in
his church, than for great men to have in their houses not only ‘vessels
of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; some to honour, and
some to dishonour.’ By these very apologies it appears that Satan by
this device of error designs to shake men’s faith and to drive them
from their religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>7. Seventhly, Neither can this, <i>that corrupt doctrines bring forth
corrupt practices</i>, be of any less weight with Satan, or less engaging
for the pursuit of this design, than any of the forementioned reasons.</p>

<p>Corrupt doctrines are embraced as the very truth of God by the
deluded; and one way or other, directly or consequentially, they lead
on practice, and that with the highest security and confidence, as if
they were very truths indeed.</p>

<p>The devil then hath this great advantage by error, that if he can
but corrupt the minds of men, especially in the more weighty and
fundamental points of religion, then by a great ease and without any
more labour he hath gained them to the practice of whatsoever these
corrupted principles will lead unto. No course can be taken that
with greater expedition and prevalency can introduce profane debaucheries
than this. Thus he conquers parties and multitudes, as a
victorious general takes cities and whole countries, by surrender;
whereas his particular temptations to sin are but inconsiderable, less
successful <i>picqueerings</i><a id="FNanchor_218_218" href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> in comparison; and when he hath once corrupted
the understandings of men, he hath by that means a command
over their consciences, and doth not now urge to evil in the notion of
a devil or tempter, but as an angel of light, or rather as a usurper of
divine authority. He requires, he commands these wicked practices
as necessary duties, or at least gives a liberty therein, as being harmless
allowances. This difference was of old observed in Satan’s
management of persecution and error, that in the former he did compel
men to deny Christ, but by the latter he did teach them. <i>In persecutione
cogit homines negare Christum, nunc docet.</i></p>

<p>That the lives and practices of men are so concerned by corrupt
doctrines, may appear to any that are but indifferently acquainted
with Scripture or history. We are told by the apostle Paul that
faith and conscience stand so related to each other that they live and
die together, and that when the one is shipwrecked the other is
drowned for company, 1 Tim. i. 19. In Phil. iii. 2, he seems severely
harsh against those of the concision; he calls them dogs, ‘Beware of
dogs; beware of evil workers.’ The reason of which expression I apprehend
lies not so much in these resemblances, that dogs spoil the
flock by devouring, or that they are fawning creatures, or that they
are industrious in prosecution of their prey,—though in all these particulars
false teachers may be compared to dogs, for they spare not the
flock, they compass sea and land to gain disciples, and they entice them
with fair speeches,—but rather he intends the similitude to express
the profane life and carriage of these seducers, for dogs are filthy
creatures, to a proverb, ‘The dog to his vomit.’ And common
prostitutes, for their uncleanness, were called dogs in the Old Testament.
So some expound Deut. xxiii. 18, ‘The hire of a whore, or the
price of a dog.’ And we have full and clear descriptions of seducers
from their wicked and abominable practices: 2 Peter ii. 10, ‘They
that walk after the flesh, in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government;
presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak
evil of dignities: ver. 14, ‘Having eyes full of adultery, and that can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>not
cease from sin; an heart exercised with covetous practices;
cursed children:’ ver. 18, ‘They allure through the lusts of the flesh,
through much wantonness.’ Jude 4, ‘There are certain men crept in
unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation; ungodly
men, turning the grace of God into lasciviousness:’ ver. 16,
‘These are murderers, complainers, walking after their own lusts,’ &amp;c.
2 Tim. iii. 2-5, ‘Men shall be lovers of their own selves; covetous,
boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded,
lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; of this sort are
they which creep into houses.’ All which do set forth heretical persons
as the most scandalous wicked wretches that we shall meet with;
grossly filthy in themselves, corrupted in all the duties of their relations,
natural and civil; defiled in all the ways of their converse with
men.</p>

<p>Neither are these wicked practices issuing from gross errors to be
looked upon as rare, accidental, or extraordinary effects thereof, but as
the natural and common fruits of them; for Christ makes this to be
the very special property and note whereby false prophets may be discovered,
Mat. vii. 16, ‘Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men
gather grapes off thorns, or figs off thistles?’ &amp;c. These fruits were
not their doctrines, but their lives; for to know false prophets by
false doctrines is no more than to know false doctrine by false doctrine.
If any object that many false teachers appeared in the shape
of seeming holiness and strictness of life, they may be answered from
Christ’s own words; for there he tells us, to avoid mistakes, that
their first appearance, and it may be the whole lives of some of the
first seedsmen of any error, is under the form of sanctity: ‘They come
to you in sheep’s clothing,’ in an outward appearance of innocency
and plausible pretences; but then he adds, that their fruits afterward
will discover them. A tree at its first planting is not discovered what
it is, but give it time to grow to its proper fruitfulness, and then you
may know of what kind it is; so that we need not affirm that damnable
doctrines produce wicked lives in all that entertain them at the
very first. It is enough for discovery if there be a natural consequential
tendency in such doctrines to practical impieties, or that at last
they produce them, though not in all, yet in many.</p>

<p>And that this matter hath been always found to be so, all history
doth confirm. Such there were in the apostles’ days, as is evident by
their complaints. Such there were in the church of Pergamos: Rev.
ii. 14, ‘Thou hast them that hold the doctrine of Balaam; who taught
Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel; to eat
things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.’ There were
also the Nicolaitans, of whom Christ declares his abhorrency, ver. 15.
In the church of Thyatira there was the ‘woman Jezebel, who taught
and seduced many’ of that church to the like abominable doctrines
and practices, ver. 20. Besides these, the apostle John was troubled
with the abominable Gnostics, [and] the filthy Carpocratians, who
taught that men must sin and do the will of all the devils, or else
they could not evade principalities and powers, who would no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>wise
be pleased to suffer them to escape to the superior heavens. Of
these men and their licentious doctrine doth he speak, 1 John iii. 6,
&amp;c., that they that are born of God indeed, must not, dare not, cannot
give themselves up to a liberty in such abominations.</p>

<p>The same fruits of corrupt doctrine appeared after the apostles’
days. What was Montanus, but an impure wretch? What were his
two companion prophetesses, Priscilla and Maximilla, but infamous
adulteresses? The Priscillianists, the Manichees, and abundance
more, left the stink of their profaneness behind them, by reason of
whom, according to Peter’s prophecy, 2 Peter ii. 2, ‘The way of truth
was evil spoken of.’</p>

<p>Later times have also given in full evidence of this truth. How
shameful and abominable were the lives of John of Leyden and the
rest of those German enthusiasts! Who reads the story of Hacket and
Coppinger without detestation of their wicked practices! What better
have the Familists and libertines of New and Old England been!
Some were turned off to highest ranting, in all profaneness of swearing,
drinking, adultery, and the defying of a godly life; and this, under the
unreasonable boast of spirit and perfection.<a id="FNanchor_219_219" href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> The heavens may blush
and the earth be astonished at these things! But in the meantime
Satan hugs himself in his success, and encourageth himself to further
attempts in propagating error, seeing it brings in so great a harvest of
sin.</p>

<p>8. Eighthly, In this design of false doctrine Satan is never altogether
out; if he cannot thus defile their lives, yet it is a thousand to
one but <i>he obstructs their graces by it</i>. What greater hindrance can
there be to conversion than error! The word of truth is the means
by which God, through his Spirit, doth beget us; it is part of that
image of God that is implanted in us: it is God’s voice to the soul to
awaken it. It cannot then be imagined that God will give the
honour of that work to any error; neither can truth take place or
have its effect upon a soul forestalled with a contrary falsehood.
Falsehood in possession will keep truth at the door. Neither is conversion
only hindered by such errors as directly contradict converting
truths, but also by collateral non-fundamental errors; as they fill the
minds of men with prejudice against those that profess another persuasion,
so that for their own beloved error’s sake men will not entertain
a warning or conviction from those that dissent from their
opinions: they first account them enemies, and then they despise their
message. It is no small matter in Satan’s way to have such an
obstruction at hand in the grand concern of conversion. Yet this is
further serviceable to him, to hinder or weaken the graces of the
converted already. If he can set God’s children a-madding upon
error, or make them fond of novelties, he will by this means exhaust
the vigour and strength of their hearts, so that the substantials of
religion will be neglected. For as hurtful plants engross all the
moisture and fatness of the earth where they stand, and impoverish it
into an inability for the nourishment of those that are of greater
worth, so doth error possess itself of the strength of the spirit, and in
the meantime neglected graces dwindle into emptiness, and ‘fade as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
leaf.’ The most curious questions and opinions that are, contribute
nothing to the establishment of the heart; it is only grace that doth
that: Heb. xiii. 9, ‘The heart is established with grace,’ and not
with disputes about meats; nay, they do grace a prejudice, in that
they make it sick and languishing—for to that sense is the original,
in 1 Tim. vi. 4, ‘Doting about questions,’ or growing diseased, because
of the earnest prosecution of opinions, Νοσῶν περὶ ζητήσεις.</p>

<p>9. Ninthly, Error hath yet another mischief in it, which makes it
not a little desirable to Satan; and that is <i>the judgment or punishment
that it brings</i>. So that it every way answers the devil’s hatred against
both soul and body. The blessings of prosperity and peace do attend
the triumphal chariot of truth: Ps. lxxxv. 11, 12, ‘Truth shall spring
out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from heaven.’
And then it follows, that ‘the Lord shall give that which is good, and
our land shall yield her increase.’ But on the contrary, error doth
more provoke God than men are aware. How often did God desolate
the Israelites, set a fire in their cities, and gave them into the hands
of their enemies, because of their changing the truth of God into a
lie, and worshipping and serving the creature more than the Creator!
God left not the church of Pergamos and Thyatira without severe
threatenings for the error of the Nicolaitans: Rev. ii. 16, ‘Repent, or
else I will come unto thee quickly.’ Ver. 22, ‘I will cast them into
great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds, and I will kill her
children with death.’ And accordingly God fulfilled his threatening
upon them, by bringing in the Saracens to desolate them, and to
possess their land—as he also brought the Goths upon the empire for
the Arian heresy. How is Satan pleased to labour in a design that
will kindle the wrath of the Almighty!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_II_2">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of the advantages which Satan hath, and useth, for the introduction
of error; as</i> (1.) <i>From his own power of spiritual fascination.
That there is such a power, proved from Scripture, and from the
effects of it.</i> (2.) <i>From our imperfection of knowledge; the particulars
thereof explained.</i> (3.) <i>From the bias of the mind. What
things do bias it, and the power of them to sway the understanding.
</i>(4.) <i>From curiosity.</i> (5.) <i>From atheistical debauchery of conscience.</i></p>


<p>That Satan may the better speed in his design, he carefully takes
notice of, and diligently improves all advantages. Indeed all his
stratagems are advantages taken against us; for so the apostle, in his
caution to the Corinthians, calls his devices, ‘lest Satan should get an
advantage of us,’ 2 Cor. ii. 11. But here I only understand those that
are more general, which are the grounds and encouragements to his
particular machinations against men, and which also direct him in
his procedure. These are,</p>

<p>1. First, Satan’s own power of <i>spiritual fascination</i>, by which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
infatuates the minds of men, and deludes them, as the external senses
are deceived by enchantments or witchcraft.</p>

<p>That Satan is a cunning sophister, and can put fallacies upon the
understanding; that by subtle objections or arguments he can obtrude
a falsehood upon the belief of the unskilful and unwary; that he can
betray the judgment by the affections, are things of common practice
with him. But that which I am now to speak of is of a higher
nature, and though it may probably take in much of his common
method of ordinary delusion, yet in this it differs, at least that it is
more efficacious and prevalent; for as his power over the children of
disobedience is so great that he can ‘lead them captive at his will,’
except when he is countermanded by the Almighty, so hath he, by
special commission, a power to lead those to error effectually, without
missing his end, that have prepared themselves for that spiritual
judgment by a special provocation; and for aught we know, as he
hath an extraordinary power which he exerts at such times, so may
he have an extraordinary method which he is not permitted to practise
daily, nor upon all.</p>

<p>That such a power as this the devil hath, is believed by those
whose learning and experience have made their judgments of great
value with serious men; and thus some do describe it: It is a delusion
with a kind of magical enchantment; so Calvin, Gal. iii. 1: a satanical
operation whereby the senses of men are deluded; thus Perkins,
who after he had asserted that Satan can corrupt the fantasy or
imagination, he compares this spiritual witchcraft to such diseases of
melancholy, that make men believe that they are, or do, what they are
not or do not, as in the disease called <i>lycanthropia</i>; and to the
enchantments of Jannes and Jambres, who deluded the senses of
Pharaoh. Others more fully, call it ‘a more vehement operation of the
great impostor, whereby he obtrudes some noxious error upon the
mind, and persuades with such efficacy that it is embraced with confidence,
defended strenuously, and propagated zealously.’<a id="FNanchor_220_220" href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>A particular account of the way and manner by which the devil
doth this, is a task beyond sober inquiry. It may suffice us to know
that such power he hath, and this I shall confirm from Scripture, and
from the effects of such delusion.</p>

<p>(1.) First, There are several scriptures which assert a power in
Satan to bewitch the minds of men into error, from which I shall
draw such notes as may confirm and in part explain this truth in
hand.</p>

<p>And I shall begin with that of Gal. iii. 1, ‘O foolish Galatians,
who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth?’ &amp;c.
The word which the apostle here useth for bewitching, as grammarians
and critics note,<a id="FNanchor_221_221" href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> is borrowed from the practice of witches and sor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>cerers,
who use by secret powers to bind the senses, and to effect mischiefs.
It is true he speaks of false apostles, but he intends Satan as
the chief workman; and this he transfers to signify Satan’s power
upon the mind, in blinding the understanding for the entertainment of
error. Neither can anything be objected why this place should not
prove a fascinating power in Satan, such as we have been speaking of,
but this, that it may be supposed to intend no more than an ordinary
powerful persuasion by arguments. Yet this may be answered, not
only from the authority of learned interpreters, who apprehend the
apostle and his expression to intend more, but also from some concomitant
particulars in the text. He calls them ‘foolish Galatians,’
as we translate it, but the original goes a little higher, to signify a
madness; and withal he seems to be surprised with wonder at the
power of Satan upon them, which had not only prevailed against the
truth, but against such evident manifestations of it as they had when
they were so plainly, fully, and efficaciously instructed; for ‘before
their eyes Jesus Christ had been evidently set forth;’ which expressions
and carriage cannot rationally be thought to befit a common
ordinary case.<a id="FNanchor_222_222" href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<p>Next to this, let us a little consider that famous scripture in 2 Thes.
ii. 9-11, ‘Whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all
power ... and for this cause, God shall send them strong delusions,
that they should believe a lie.’ I shall from this place observe
a few things, which if put together will clear the truth we speak of:
As, first, In this delusion here mentioned, the apostle doth not only set
down extraordinary outward means, as signs and lying wonders, but
also suits these extraordinary means with a suitable concomitant inward
power; for by ‘power’ I do not understand, as some, [Piscator
and Sclater,] a power of shewing signs and doing wonders, as if the
apostle had said, ἐν δυνάμει σημέιων καὶ τεράτων, with the power of
signs and wonders—for the words will not well bear that without
some unnatural straining; but I understand by it a power, distinct
from the signs and wonders, by which he moves their hearts to believe,
by an inward working upon their minds, striking in with the outward
means of lying miracles propounded to their senses. And we may the
better satisfy ourselves in this interpretation, if we compare it with
Rom. xv. 19,<a id="FNanchor_223_223" href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> where not only the power of doing wonders is expressed
by a phrase, proper and different from this of the text in hand,
‘through mighty signs and wonders,’ or in the power of signs and
wonders, but it is also clearly distinguished from the power of the
Spirit of God, in working upon the hearts, to make those wonders efficacious
and persuasive; so that, as in the Spirit of God we observe a
power to do wonders, and a power to work upon the heart by these
wonders, we may conclude that this wicked spirit hath also, in order
to sin and delusion, this twofold power. But secondly, I note further,
That this power is called a special energy of peculiar force and efficacy
in its working—κατ’ ἔνέργειαν τοῦ Σατανᾶ. The strange inexpressible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
strength of it seems to stand in need of many words for explanation.
He calls it ‘all power’—ἐν πάσῃ δυνάμει—which as well notes the
degree and height, as the variety of its operations, and then the energy,
the virtue, operativeness, and strength of power. Thirdly, It is also
to be observed that Satan’s success and exercise of this power of delusion
depends upon the commission of God, and that therefore it is
extraordinary, and not permitted to him but upon special occasions
and provocation, ‘for this cause God shall send,’ &amp;c. Fourthly, The
success of this power when exercised is certain. They are not only
strong delusions, in regard of the power from whence they come, but
also in regard of the event; those upon whom they come cannot but
believe. Infatuation and pertinaciousness are the certain fruits of it.<a id="FNanchor_224_224" href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>
Fifthly, The proof of all is manifest in the quality of the errors entertained,
for they are palpable gross lies, and yet believed as the very
truths of God, and they are in such weighty points as do evidently
determine the soul to ruin, ‘lies to be damned,’ which two things are
sufficient proofs of spiritual fascination; it being unimaginable that
rational men, and especially such as were instructed to a belief of a
contrary truth, should so far degenerate from the light of reason as to
be deluded by gross and apparent lies, and of such high importance,
except their minds had been blinded in some extraordinary way.
Some further confirmation may be added to this truth from 1 Kings
xxii. 21, ‘And there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord,
and said, I will persuade him.... I will go forth, and I will
be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou
shalt persuade him, and prevail also.’ I might here take notice of
Satan’s readiness in this work, as wanting neither skill nor will, if he
were but always furnished with a commission; as also the powerful
efficacy of spiritual witchcraft, where it pleaseth the Lord to permit
to Satan the exercise of his power, ‘Thou shalt persuade, and prevail
also.’ But that which I would observe here, is something relating to
the manner of his proceeding in these delusions. He attempted to
deceive the false prophets, and by them to delude Ahab; and both,
by being a lying spirit in the mouth of the prophets, which necessarily,
as Peter Martyr observes, implies, (1.) That Satan had a power so
strongly to fix upon their imaginary<a id="FNanchor_225_225" href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> faculty the species, images, or
characters of what was to be suggested, that he could not only make
them apprehend what he presented to their minds, but also make them
believe that it was a divine inspiration, and consequently true; for
these false prophets did not speak hypocritically what they knew to
be false, but what they confidently apprehended to be true, as appears
by the whole story. (2.) He could irritate and inflame their desires
to publish these their persuasions to the king, after the manner of
divine prophecies. (3.) He had a further power of persuading Ahab
that his prophets spake truth.<a id="FNanchor_226_226" href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<p>That passage of Rom. i. 28, ‘God gave them over to a reprobate
mind,’ doth give some account how men are brought by the devil into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
these false persuasions. A reprobate mind is a mind injudicious, a
mind that hath lost its power of discerning—Νοῦς ἀδοκιμός. It is
plain then that he can so besot and blind the mind that it shall not be
startled at things of greatest absurdity or inconveniency.</p>

<p>If any yet further inquire how he can do these things; we must
answer, that his particular ways and methods in this case we know
not: only it may be added, that, Eph. iv. 17, Paul tells us he can
make their ‘minds vain, and darken their understandings.’ By mind,
Νοὸς, the seat of principles is commonly understood. By understanding,
Διάνοια, the reasoning or discursive faculty, which is the seat of
conclusions: so that his power seems to extend to the obliterating of
principles, and can also disable them to make right inferences, insomuch
that he wants nothing that may be necessary to the begetting
of strong persuasions of any falsehood which he suggests, according to
what is intimated, Gal. v. 3, ‘This persuasion cometh not of him that
called you’—that is, not of God, but of the devil.</p>

<p>From all these scriptures then it appears that this spiritual fascination
is a power in Satan, which he exerts, by special commission,
upon those that receive not the truth in the love of it, by which he can
so strongly imprint falsehoods upon their minds, that they become
unable to discern betwixt truth and a lie, and so by darkening their
understanding, they are effectually persuaded to believe an error.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, There is yet another proof of this spiritual witchcraft,
from the consideration <i>of the effects of it upon the deluded, and the
uncouth, strange, unnatural way of its proceeding</i>. Let all particulars
of this kind be put together, and it will not be found possible to give
any other rational account of some errors than that of extraordinary
delusion.</p>

<p>[1.] First, Let us take notice of the <i>vileness and odiousness of some
errors that have prevailed upon men</i>. Some have been plainly sottish,
so evidently foolish that it cannot be imagined that men that entertained
them had at that time the use of reason, or any competent
understanding. This very consideration the prophet Isaiah insists
upon largely, chap. xliv. 9-21, where he taxeth them smartly for the
senseless doltishness of their error in worshipping idols. He tells
them the matter of it is the work of nature, a cedar, oak, or ash, that
they themselves possibly had planted, and the rain did nourish it,
ver. 14. He tells them also that the form of it was from the art of the
workman, the smith, or carpenter: ver. 12, 13, ‘The smith with the
tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and
worketh it with the strength of his arms.... The carpenter
stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with
planes, and he marketh it out with a compass.’ He further minds
them, that without any reverence they make use of the residue of the
materials out of which they formed their idol to common services of
dressing their meat and warming themselves. ‘He burneth part
thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast,
and is satisfied; yea, warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I
have seen the fire,’ ver. 16. Then he accuseth them of sottishness,
in that the ‘residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image:
he falleth down to it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god,’ ver. 17. And from all this
he concludes, that seeing this is so directly contrary to common reason
and understanding—which in the ordinary exercise of it would easily
have freed them from such a dotage; for if they had but ‘knowledge
or understanding to say, I have burnt part of it in the fire; I have
baked bread, and shall I make the residue an abomination?’ ver. 19,
they could not have been so foolish. It must, then, of necessity be a
spiritual infatuation. ‘Their eyes were shut that they cannot see, and
their hearts, that they cannot understand,’ ver. 18. ‘A deceived heart
hath turned him aside,’ ver. 20. Other errors there are that lead to
beastly and unnatural villanies, such as directly cross all the sober
principles of mankind, the natural principles of modesty, the most
general and undoubted principles of religion and holiness, as when
adulteries, swearing, ranting, going naked, cruelties, murders, outrageous
confusions and madness, are clothed with pretences of spirit, revelation,
freedom in the use of the creature, exercise of love, and having
all things common, &amp;c.: of which sad instances have been given more
than once. Let any sober man consider how it could come to pass,
that men that have reason enough to defend them against such furies,
and the knowledge of Scripture, which everywhere—with the greatest
happiness imaginable and highest earnestness—doth prohibit such
practices as most abominable, and doth direct to a sober, just, modest,
humble, inoffensive life, should entertain notwithstanding, such errors
as transform men into beasts, monsters, or rather devils, and religion
into the grossest impieties; and all this as the perfection and top of
religious attainment commanded in the word of God or by his Spirit,
and well-pleasing to most holy and pure divine majesty! Let it, I
say, be left to the consideration of men how it should be, without some
such extraordinary cause as hath been mentioned.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Let it be observed also, that some errors bring with
them some <i>extraordinary, strange, unnatural, unusual actions</i>, and
put men into such odd garbs, postures, and behaviours, that it is easy
to see they are acted by a force or power not human. Some have
been carried to do things beyond whatsoever might have been expected
from the age and capacities of the parties; as ecstasies, trances, and
quakings of little children; their prophesying and speaking Scripture
threatenings after such fits. Some have been acted in a way of ecstatical
fury; as Montanus, of whom Eusebius witnesseth,<a id="FNanchor_227_227" href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> that ‘sometimes
he would be seized upon by a kind of malignant spirit, and would
suddenly break forth into a rage and madness, and presently utter rash
and bold speeches, strange, unusual voices, with prophesyings; insomuch
that he was judged by those that saw him to be acted by the
devil.’ Others have been as in a more sober spiritual rapture; an
instance whereof I shall give you from Mr Baxter in these words:
‘I have heard from an ancient godly man that knew Arthington and
Coppinger, that they were possessed with the spirit of the Grundletonians.
The same man affirmed that he went but once among them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
himself, and after prayer they breathed on him as giving him the
Holy Ghost; and he was so strangely transported for three days that
he was not the same man, and his family wondered what was the
matter with him: he had no confession of sin, but an elevated strain
in prayer, as if he had been in strange raptures; and after three days
he was as before, and came no more at them.’<a id="FNanchor_228_228" href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> Some have been carried
into childish and ridiculous actions: such was the behaviour of Jo. Gilpin
in his delusion at Kendal in Westmoreland; as his going to the
fiddler’s house, playing upon a bass viol in token of spiritual melody;
his creeping up the streets upon hands and knees in token of bearing
his cross; his making marks on the ground, and beating it, as his
mortification of sin; and a great many more things of like nature.<a id="FNanchor_229_229" href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>Such things as these are as spiritual marks and characters engraven
upon errors, by which a diabolical power, moving and acting such
deluded creatures, like so many puppets, is evidently discovered.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, When we see not only idiots, and those whose defect
of understanding might put them under the power of an ordinary
cheat, thus imposed upon, <i>but men otherwise intelligent, rational, and
serious</i>, blinded with follies, taken with apparent dotages, admiring
trifles, and carried away with things which common reason would
teach them to abhor, it is more than suspicious that it is not any probability
of truth or excellency in the error that prevails with them,
but a spiritual power that doth bewitch them. When we consider
that such a learned man as Tertullian begins to admire such a wretch
as Montanus; or such a one as Arthington led away with Hacket
and Coppinger; or such a man as Kneperdollin seduced by John of
Leyden; and especially such numbers of wise and seemingly sober
and religious persons, going down the stream after irrational and
plainly irreligious errors,—what else can be apprehended to be the
cause but a powerful satanical delusion?</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Add we to these the consideration of <i>the suddenness
of the prevalency of such errors against plain and evident truths</i>,
which is a circumstance taken notice of by the apostle: Gal. i. 6, ‘I
marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the
grace of Christ unto another gospel.’ In which case we may observe
it usually falls out that men’s affections prevent their discoveries; at
the first view they are taken, before they understand what the error is,
and they are persuaded before they know.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly and lastly, That <i>the earnestness of the prosecution by
which they maintain and propagate the error is a kind of unnatural
fury, which hurries men with violence into an unyielding stiffness, to the
stifling of all kind of charity and consideration</i>. These things put together,
I say, makes the matter in hand evident; when men otherwise
rational are at first touch highly enamoured with, and violent in the
pursuit of errors that are sottish or devilish, we can resolve it into
nothing less than into that of the apostle, ‘Who hath bewitched you?’
The improvement of this first and great advantage for the introduction
of errors is more than can be well expressed; but he hath besides
other advantages which he noway neglects: among which,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>2. Secondly, <i>Our imperfection in knowledge</i> is none of the least.
If our knowledge had been perfect, it would have been a task too hard
for the devil to make us erroneous; for men do not err but so far as
they are ignorant. To impose upon men against clear and certain
knowledge is impossible. Men cannot believe that to be true which
they know to be false. It would be as silly for Satan to make such
attempts as for a juggler to endeavour the deception of those that
know and see the ways of his conveyances as well as himself. That
our knowledge is imperfect, I shall prove and explain in the following
particulars:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>The Scripture plainly asserts it</i>. The greatest number
of men which are in an unregenerate estate are expressly called foolish,
blind, ignorant—men that are in darkness, men that do not know nor
consider, that perish through ignorance. Others that, in comparison
to these, are called ‘children of the light,’ and such as ‘see with open
face,’ are notwithstanding, when compared to a state of perfection,
represented to be in the non-age of their knowledge, unripe, imperfect.
The apostle doth so express it, 1 Cor. xiii. 9, ‘We know in
part, we prophesy in part.’ In the explanation of this, he compares
our attainments in this world to the understanding, thoughts, and
speakings of children, ver. 11: concludes, ver. 12, that all our knowledge
gives us but a dark, imperfect reflection of things: ‘we see
through a glass darkly.’</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Men that have had the clearest heads, and have
been at the greatest pains in their inquiries to find out truths, have
brought back the clear conviction of their own ignorance</i>. Austin
confesseth that in the Scriptures—which he made his chief study—the
things which he knew not were more than the things he understood.<a id="FNanchor_230_230" href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a>
Chytræus, in humble modesty, goes a little further: ‘My dearest
knowledge,’ saith he, ‘is to know that I know nothing;’ and it will
be a clear demonstration of that man’s ignorance that boasts of his
knowledge; his own mouth will prove against him that ‘he knows
nothing as he ought to know,’ [1 Cor. viii. 2.]</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, The consideration of <i>the nature of the things which are
the objects upon which we employ our search</i> will sufficiently convince
us that we do comprehend but very little. For though the Scripture
hath expressed the main concerns of eternal life so fully that they are
as clear as light, and need no such stretch of the brain but that the
meanest capacities may as certainly understand them as they understood
anything of common business; as, that Christ died for sinners;
that without faith it is impossible to please God; that without holiness
no man shall see his face, &amp;c. Yet, as Peter speaks, 2 Pet. iii. 16,
‘There are many things that are hard to be understood,’ δυσνόητά
τινα]. There are difficulties, depths, and mysteries. Some things,
whereof we have but dark touches in Scripture, though enough to let
us know that such things there are, and, to humble us for our ignorance,
are in their own nature sublime, bounded on all sides with
rocks and precipices, where our near and bold approaches are prohibited:
such are those things that concern the decrees of God, the
Trinity, &amp;c. Other things are dark and uncertain to us, from their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
very proximity to us—as some are pleased to fancy the reason. Such
are the nature, faculties, and workings of our own souls within us—which
we cannot directly see, as the eye sees not itself, and do but,
as it were, guess by dark reflections. Some things in Scripture are accidentally
obscure to us that were plain to those that heard them first,
to whom they were spoken and written; for now to the understanding
of a great many passages there is necessary the knowledge of the
tongues in which they were dictated, of the histories of those times to
which they severally related; as also of the particular customs of the
Jewish nation, which gave a mould and form to a great many Scripture
assertions; all which were easy and familiar to those that knew
the exact propriety of such languages, were acquainted thoroughly
with such histories, customs, usages, and manner of speakings; and
besides all these, the application of general rules to particular cases—where
a little circumstance may make a great alteration—is full of
puzzle and intricacy; insomuch that some have thought that there
are several cases of conscience that are not yet fully determined, and
that are like so to remain.<a id="FNanchor_231_231" href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Neither is <i>the nature of knowledge itself</i> without an
argument to prove the insufficiency of our knowledge. To know is
properly to understand things by their causes, or at least by their
effects, and to make a right result of particulars from a general maxim.
Such a kind of knowledge is necessary in religion, for setting aside
some particulars of mysterious height, about which God hath set
bounds, lest men in presumptuous boldness should adventure to ‘break
through unto the Lord to gaze;’ and some things which are the principles
of nature, or their next results, which are, upon that score,
beyond all need of inquiry—in all which it is enough to believe that
what the Scripture saith is true, without asking a further account;
yet in other things the Scripture gives us the grounds, reasons, and
proofs of what it declares or asserts, as may appear by infinite examples;
so that to know Christ died, or that we are justified by faith, or that
Christ shall come to judgment, without a knowledge of the grounds
and reasons of these things, is indeed but gross ignorance. The like
may be said of the knowledge of general precepts, without the knowledge
of their necessary application.</p>

<p>But how few are there that do thus know! The greatest part of
men satisfy themselves with the bare affirmations of Scripture, and
they resolve all into this, that the word of God saith so, or that it
is the will of God it should be so, without further inquiry.</p>

<p>And as for others, though they may know the reasons of many
things, yet are there a vast number of particulars whose reasons we
know not, though the Scripture may contain them; and as for consequences,
and the application of general rules, their just limitation, and
the enumeration of the cases wherein they are true or false, it is that
that keeps the wits of men upon the rack perpetually.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, <i>The unsuitableness of our capacities to those objects of
knowledge</i> may be particularly considered as a further confirmation of
our ignorance. The incapacity of the vulgar is generally observed.
Some we find so grossly ignorant, that they are incapable to comprehend
the easiest matters; and this makes their persuasion to some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
plain truths so very difficult, that when they are, as it were, ‘brayed
in a mortar’ by a multitude of unreasonable<a id="FNanchor_232_232" href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> arguments, yet their
ignorance ‘departs not from them,’ but they will stubbornly hold the
conclusion of their own fancy, whatever become of the premises. Those
that are of a higher form, and seem to understand a great many particulars
in religion, are ordinarily unable to conjoin all truths into one
entire proportionable body: they heap up several notions that they
hear here and there, but know not their consistencies; insomuch that
they either are like children, who know all the letters of the alphabet,
without the skill to frame words or sentences out of them, being unable
to give an account how their notions are related one to another, or to
the whole; or if they attempt such a thing, they hang inconsistent
things on the same thread, and do but <i>humano capiti cervicem jungere
equinam</i>. If these instances, and a great many more of like kind, were
not at hand, yet the very condescensions of our great prophet the Lord
Jesus, and of his disciples in their ways of teaching, do evince that the
capacities of men are low—that they are ‘dull of hearing, children in
understanding.’ The course they took was to instruct them in a
plain, familiar way, by parables and examples. Thus were they ‘fed as
babes in Christ,’ according to the apostle’s similitude, with ‘milk, and
not with strong meat, because they were not able to bear it,’ 1 Cor. iii.
1. And yet Christ sometimes complained that this would not do. For
so he speaks, John iii. 12, ‘If I have told you earthly things,’ that
is, divine truth in earthly and common similitudes, ‘and ye believe
not,’ <i>i.e.</i>, cannot apprehend them, ‘how shall ye believe if I tell you of
heavenly things?’ How unable, then, would you be to understand these
truths if I should speak in language and expression properly suited
to their natures? A great check to our slowness of apprehension.</p>

<p>But possibly some may expect higher matters from those that are
exalted above the common rank of men by the repute they have of
learning. And indeed it cannot be denied but such have very great
advantages for the widening of their capacities; yet are they not such
as wholly take away the distemper, but still so much incapacity may
be seen in them as will sufficiently justify the charge of imperfection
in knowledge against the most learned. Let us bring in some instances,
and it will be evident:</p>

<p>(1.) <i>The greatest errors that have most disturbed the church in all
ages have had their rise from learned men.</i> The names of their
authors are marked upon their foreheads. These known errors are so
many, that they fill whole volumes. The result of which consideration
will be this, that learned men have often been very dangerously mistaken.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>The present contentions and disputes of men</i>, managed on all
hands with so much earnestness, wherein one party triumphs over
another, and all, in their own apprehensions, are victorious. Instead
of conquests by arguments and answers, each party is but more
confirmed in its own apprehensions; and yet the one-half is certainly
wrong, and perhaps in many things both parties are mistaken. This,
I say, sufficiently shows the incapacities of the learned; for if every
capacity were truly correspondent to truth, there would be no more
disputes nor differences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>(3.) <i>The most learned find the business of their own persuasion and
satisfaction in many truths, in which common people have no scruple
nor doubt, very difficult</i>; because they see more objections to be answered,
and more of the weakness of arguments than others do; but
this shews their capacities are not so large as some would think.</p>

<p>(4.) Let us once for all consider <i>that which seems to be the
highest evidence for knowledge and understanding in the learned,
and we shall find, upon just examination, it is no more than
an argument of their ignorance</i>. What is there wherein they seem
more acute and eagle-eyed than in their distinctions, by which they
would give us the most minute differences of things, and appear so
exact as if they would divide an atom, and give everything its just
weight and measure? But let us consider that, though all distinctions
are not unprofitable, their multitude is become oppressive and troublesome,
and more time must be spent in learning terms and words of
art than things; and their nicety and subtlety so great, that they
rather darken truth, and give occasion to bold spirits to undertake the
defence of any paradox. Nay, if we could sever these clearly from
their abuses, yet, seeing it is certain there are more distinctions of
terms than things, they will evince that our knowledge is more verbal
than real, and that often for a mountain of words we have but a molehill
of substantial matter. Nay, seeing we make but a sorry shift at
best by these artifices to come to some rude conceptions of things,
which otherwise we cannot in any tolerable manner comprehend, it is
as great a proof of our imperfection in knowledge, as the necessary use
of staves and crutches is an evidence of lameness. If I should pass
from this to the consideration of the multitude beyond all number of
books that are written, we shall find them but so many proclamations
of our ignorance; for if we could believe them all to contain so many
wholesome precepts of necessary truth, which yet we cannot rationally
imagine, this would imply that the greatest part wanted these informations;
and that common ignorance is not only a general distemper,
but also a distemper hard to be cured, that stands in need of such
multitudes of instructors and such varieties of helps. But if we believe
that among this infinite number of volumes there are thousands
of lies, millions of unproved conjectures, millions of millions of idle,
unprofitable fancies, then do we in express terms pronounce them
guilty of ignorance, and of ignorance so much the more dangerous, by
how much the more bold it is to avouch itself in the light, and to
obtrude itself upon the belief of others, who, instead of being better
informed by it, shall but increase their own blindness. Were there
nothing to be said but this, that there are such a vast multitude of
commentators upon the Bible, which do all pretend to expound and
explain it, it would of necessity admit of these conclusions:—[1.] That
the Bible hath in it things so dark, or at least our capacities are so
dull, that there is need of great endeavours to explain the one, or
assist the other. [2.] That the knowledge of men is imperfect; for if
all or most men could certainly interpret the Scripture, there needed
not so many volumes, but that one or two might have signified as
much as now whole libraries can do.</p>

<p>The imperfection of our knowledge being thus laid open, it is easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
to see what advantages the devil may make out of it for the promoting
of error; for it must now become our wonder, not that any man errs,
but that all do not. We find it easy to impose anything upon children;
it is an easy matter for a trifle to cheat them out of all they
have. Surely then Satan may do as much by men, who are but
‘children in understanding.’ The apostle, Eph. iv. 14, puts us in
mind of this hazard under that very similitude, ‘that we henceforth
be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every
wind of doctrine.’ How fitly doth he resemble us to children! Their
weaknesses are, [1.] Want of discerning; they see not the true worth
of things. [2.] Credulity; they believe all fair speeches and specious
promises: and the hazard of both these is in this, that it makes them
unconstant, uncertain, and fickle; and such are we made by our ignorance,
so little do we truly discern, so apt are we to believe every pretence,
for the simple believes every word, Prov. xiv. 15; that, as the
apostle’s metaphors do tell us, we are easily tossed from one conceit or
opinion to another, as a ship is by the waves, or a feather in the wind.
κλυδονιζόμενοι καὶ περιφερόμενοι.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, A third advantage which the devil takes against us in
his design of error, is <i>the bias of the mind</i>. Were our understandings
purely free, in a just and even balance toward all things propounded
to its deliberation and assent, though it were imperfect in its light, the
danger were the less; but now, in regard of the bent and sway it is
under, it is commonly partial, and inclined to one side more than to
another, and yet the matter were the less, if only one or two noted
things had the power of setting up a false light before the mind; but
there are many things that are apt to do us this mischief, which have
the same effect upon us that bribes have upon persons interested in
judgment, which not only tempts them to do wrong, but so blinds their
eyes that they know not they do so, or at least not in so great a measure.
The mind is biassed,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>Naturally to error rather than truths</i>. The corruption
of our nature is general, and doth not only dispose the will and affections
to practical iniquities, but doth also incline the understanding to
error and misapprehension. And that seems to be the ground of
Christ’s assertion against the Jews: John v. 43, ‘I am come in my
Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his
own name, him ye will receive.’ Which implies that men are naturally
more prone to believe an impostor, than one that speaks the
most certain and profitable verities; and besides this general inclination
to vanities and lies, there are, if some think right, some errors
that are formally engraven in the nature of fallen man—as that opinion
to be saved by works.<a id="FNanchor_233_233" href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> For not only do all men that have any apprehensions
of a future eternal state resolve that question of obtaining
salvation into works as the proper cause,—and indeed no other could
have been imagined, if the Scripture had not revealed the redemption
by the blood of Jesus—but the Jews in John vi. 28, when they propound
that question, ‘What shall we do, that we might work the
works of God?’ take it for granted, that works of some kind or other
are the causes of happiness. Possibly some impression of that notion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
while it was a truth, as in the state of innocency it was, may yet remain
upon our natures, though by the fall the case is altered with us.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, The mind is biassed <i>by bodily temper and complexional
inclination</i>. The varieties of complexions introduce varieties
of humours and dispositions; and the understanding being necessitated
to look through these, as so many coloured glasses, is apt to
judge, that is, to misjudge, according to the misrepresentation of
objects.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Sometimes <i>habitual acquirements have the same influence
upon the understanding that natural humours have</i>. The arts
and sciences we study, our ways of education and employment, are but
so many prejudicate prepossessions that do secretly taint the mind.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, There are also <i>accidental inclinations</i>, which, though
not customary, have the force of a second nature, because their working
is violent and impetuous, and these, which are from a wounded
conscience or excesses of melancholy, have a bias more than ordinary;
they lay violent hands upon the understanding, and with a mighty
torrent run it down. So that if an error be offered that is suitable to
such fears or misapprehensions, it can scarce miss of success. The
extraordinary turbulences of some other passions, as anger, love, &amp;c.,
have the like effect.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, <i>Vicious habits</i> do so much bias the mind, that the
understanding must needs be defiled by them. Nothing can more
prepare the mind to a wicked error than a wicked life. An error of
indulgence being so grateful to corruption may readily find favour
with the understandings of those that know not to do good, because
they have accustomed themselves to do evil.</p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, There are <i>external things</i> that have no less power on
the understanding than any of the foregoing; and these are custom,
education, and interest. These stick so close, and work so subtly,
that though there are few that are not, in disputable cases, influenced
by them, yet none are able or willing to take notice how and by what
steps they do engage them to pass sentence against truth. And indeed
that man must have a singular measure of suspicious watchfulness
and clear integrity that is not deceived by them. And the best
way to keep clear of the mischief that these may do us, is to be severe
in our suspicions on that side to which custom and interest have their
tendencies.</p>

<p>(7.) Seventhly, I might note that there is something considerable
to this purpose <i>in the nature of spirits</i>. Some spirits are unfixed and
volatile, and these are soon altered by their own unsteadiness. Others
are tenacious and unflexible; and if such be first set wrong, it is not
an easy thing that will reduce them to truth. Others are soft and
ductile, persuaded by good words as soon as strong arguments. And
again, some are of such a rough, sour, contradictious temper, that they
will sooner choose to run wrong than comply with the persuasions of
those that offer truth, even for that reason, because they are persuaded
to it; so that the truth which, if none had minded them, they of themselves
would have embraced, they will now refuse when it is pressed
upon them, out of a cross and thwarting humour, because they hate
nothing more than to do as they are bidden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>To come a little nearer, let us consider how these things shew their
power upon the mind to sway and incline it. It is indeed true, that
in things that are clearly and strongly propounded to the understanding,
it cannot but judge according to the evidence of truth, and cannot
be guided by the will to judge contrary; nay, the will—though in
things purely speculative it may retain its averseness, as also in things
practical, while they are considered only as what may be done before
the understanding hath come up to its final resolve, determining that
such things must or ought to be done—cannot but follow the light and
information of the understanding, and that according to the proportion
of its conviction; so that though in some cases a man would have
things otherwise than he believes them to be, yet he cannot believe
what he will, neither can he refuse to will what is certainly represented
to be good and necessary. <i>Tantum quisque vult, quantum intelligit
se velle debere.</i> Notwithstanding all this, the forementioned particulars
may so bias the mind that it shall not act truly and steadily, as
we may see in these three particulars:</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>In things clearly demonstrated to the understanding</i>,
though the will cannot directly oppose, nor prevail to have them judged
false, yet it can indirectly hinder the procedure of the understanding,
and divert it from fixing its consideration upon the truth, or from
working itself into positive determinations for bringing it into practice.
<i>Intellectus sequitur voluntatem quoad exercitium, non quoad specificationem.</i>
Thus many that cannot but believe there is a God, and
that his law is true, being biassed by their lusts, the power of pleasures
or interest, &amp;c., do prevail upon their understandings to take up other
objects of consideration; so that they are said to forget God, and to
cast his commandments behind their backs, as also not to remember
their latter end, though they cannot but believe that they shall die.
Truth may be imprisoned and fettered, where it cannot be slain. We
read of ‘holding the truth in unrighteousness,’ Rom. i. 18, which was
this, that those heathens of whom the apostle speaks, by reason of their
vicious inclinations and practices, though they could not obliterate
those notices of equity and religion that were imprinted on their minds,
yet they kept them at under, as captives in a dungeon, and suffered
them not to rise up in a just practical improvement. Now the wrong
that is done to truth this way is not only by rendering it unfruitful
and useless at present, but hereby the devil hath his advantage in the
gaining of time to gather together more forces against that truth, and
by frequent onsets of contrary arguings, especially upon the advantage
of the mind’s indifferency and remissness, begot by long and often
diversions, to set another face upon it, and by degrees to overturn
former persuasions. This was the very case of the heathens in the
place last cited, who, being first swayed by their impieties, became
unwilling to give way to those dictates of light and justice which they
had; and having thus gratified their lusts, the devil further prevailing
with them to find evasions from the power of those truths, they began
to make unsuitable inferences from these premises, which they could
not deny, and so became sottish and vain in their reasonings, ‘changing
the glory of the uncorruptible God, into an image made like unto corruptible
man.’ And by such practices against truth, they at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
changed the truth into a lie, ver. 25, and at long-run obliterated the
knowledge of God out of their minds. This is Satan’s old method of
overturning truth at last, by diverting the mind from receiving the
present powerful impressions of those principles.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, But in things doubtful, where there is not a clear
certainty what is truth, but contrary opinions strive with such equal
confidence, that it is difficult to determine which hath the conquest,
there the mind may be so swayed by its bias that it <i>may give approbation
to error; nay, where, upon a fair and indifferent trial, truth
hath the greater appearance of strength, and error nothing else than
little shadows or appearances of reason to shelter itself under</i>; yet
that way may the mind be inclined by the aforesaid things. We have
a more easy and facile belief for what we would have than for what
we would not. Though there is nothing more noted by common
experience than this, that men are usually drawn aside by humours,
inclinations, interests, and education, &amp;c., to judge well of that which
an unprejudiced person would easily see to be weak, unjust, ridiculous,
or unreasonable; yet how these considerations and tempers do exert
their force upon the understanding to draw it into a compliance, or by
what secret art they can heighten probabilities, and lessen objections;
or by what insensible progress they move, that men thus carried do
not perceive that they are under such a force, is not so very discernible.
How often may we observe men, that are rational enough
to discover the pitiful shifts and poor allegations of others, with such
gravity and confidence, where their own interests are concerned, to
offer such low reasonings and extravagant impertinences, that all that
hear them are ready to laugh at their folly; and yet they themselves
entertain no less than persuasions of the invincibleness of their arguings.
They so eagerly desire what they would establish, that they
think anything is enough to justify it, and are apt to imagine that
their shifts and excuses appear as strong to others as to themselves. I
have known some that, by the sway of interest, have changed their
opinions in religious matters, and have really become otherwise persuaded
than they had been formerly, and not as some who, for advantage,
will knowingly take up what they cannot believe to be true, and
have not been able to say that they have met with new arguments or
new answers to objections, but I know not how arguments, which they
had contemned, and laid by for weak, began to look big upon them.
The arguments by which their former persuasion was upheld grew
insensibly feeble in their hands; the one revived, gathered strength,
after they had a little cherished them, by thinking there might be
something in them, though before they knew all the particulars, and
could not instance in anything which they had not formerly notified
and answered; and the other sort of arguments grew weaker and
weaker, till at last they parted with all good conceit of them; so that
such a change was but as the turning of the tables. That which
acted behind the curtain, and wrought this change of the fancy, could
be no other than some of the forementioned things that biassed their
mind; for where the arguments, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, were the same, the
alteration of opinion, where men are not so wicked as to go directly
against their own light, must of necessity be imputed to the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
positions of external things, and the different humours and inclinations
begot by them, even as the different stations of men in the prospect
of some pictures represent them variously; one way they give the
shape of a beautiful face, another way they express the ugly deformity
of a devil; or as different reflections of the sunbeams upon the same
object clothe it with several colours. The Scripture doth also give
us notice of this advantage which the devil takes from the inclinations
of men to lead them into mistakes. That of Micah ii. 11, ‘If a man,
walking in the spirit of falsehood, do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto
thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this
people,’ hath this for its foundation, that, let the error be never so
gross and palpable, as if a man should prophesy a liberty for drunkenness,
if it be suitable to the sway of people’s humours, it will readily
enough be embraced, ‘he shall be a prophet to this people,’ that is,
such a prophet will easily prevail with such a people; their vicious
inclinations fit them for any impression of a suitable error. The
apostle Paul also found this too true in the heresies of his own times;
for he tells us that seducers had learned that cunning from the devil
to draw men to error by the sway of their lusts: 2 Tim. iii. 6, ‘They
creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, and
led away with divers lusts;’ as also 2 Tim. iv. 6, he prophesies of the
future use of this stratagem, ‘After their own lusts shall they heap to
themselves teachers.’ So that the usual prevalency of error was and
is from the underground working of lusts, humours, habits, and
inclinations, which make men willing to entertain an opinion, which
can but gratify them with a suitableness or fitness.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Where the forementioned particulars of inclination,
natural or acquired humours, custom, education, &amp;c., do neither
divert the understanding, nor engage it to close with error; yet often
do they discover how powerfully they can bias the mind, in that these
prevail with men <i>to modify and mould a truth according to the bent or
form of their inclinations</i>; as a bowl which is skilfully aimed at a
mark, goes nevertheless by a compass which its bias forceth it unto,
according to the risings or fallings of the ground it meets with in the
way. Men may arrive at real truth in the main, and yet may shape
it according to their humours. For instance, let us consider the
different modes or forms in which the same truth is represented under
the workings of different tempers. A melancholy person conceives of
all things under such reflections as fear and sadness do usually give.
If he consider God, he looks upon him in the notion of greatest severity
and justice; if upon the ways of duty, he colours them all in black,
and can scarce account anything piety which is not accompanied with
sadness and mourning; if he calls his soul to a reckoning, his conclusions
concerning himself are sad, doleful, or at best suspicious. On
the contrary, a hilarious, cheerful temper censures all sadness for
sullenness, and is apt to accuse those that go mourning in their way
for unthankful murmurers and unbelieving complainers; it interprets
God’s favourable condescensions to the weak in the greatest latitude,
and is easily persuaded to those things that are upon the utmost brink
of liberty, to which others of a more timorous disposition dare not
approach for fear of offending. This puts a higher excellency upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
the duties of praise, as the other upon fasting and mourning. Those
men that are morose and severe, they are apt to think that God
‘is such an one as themselves;’ and though they acknowledge there
is such a grace as charity, yet under a pretence of strictness they
cannot believe they are bound to exercise it towards any that are
under any failing of which they judge themselves to be free; and
therefore such men are usually very difficult in all cases wherein condescension
is to be used; they are hard to be reconciled, and after the
miscarriage of any person, are not easily satisfied of their repentance;
and in cases of dissent from their way and practice of religion, they
are commonly censorious, and conclude the worst. They again that
are naturally mild and gentle, under a pretence of charity and meekness,
are apt to become remiss in their carriages towards any brother;
and because ‘charity thinks not evil,’ they model their acknowledged
duty into the form of their own disposition, and so think they must
‘see, and yet not perceive;’ and instead of covering the ‘infirmities’
of a brother, they have a mantle to cast over every transgression. At
the same rate also do they frame their conceptions of God, as if he
was so merciful that he would scarce reckon any abomination to be
above the height of an ordinary infirmity. These are apt to think
that the mercies of God, so much praised in Scripture, signify little
less than an indulgence in transgression far above what precisians are
apt to imagine; and that it is as easy to obtain forgiveness from God
for any offence, as it is to say, ‘The Lord be merciful to me a sinner.’
Those that accustom themselves to the delights of the senses are
apt to bend the way of their religion to that humour; and think that
nothing can be solemn in worship that is not set out with garnishings
that may please the eye or ear. Nay, it is observable enough that
religion borrows some taint or shape from the various studies and
sciences of men; in some, as in many of the fathers, we may see
religion dipped in Platonism or Peripateticism. Some introduce the
distinctions and definitions of philosophy, others compel all scriptures
to submit to the laws of strict logical analysis. Thus, according to
the various mediums that men look through, are truths discoloured
and dressed up in several shapes. It is easy from these instances
to imagine that Satan must have a great advantage against us, in
point of error, from the bias of the mind.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, <i>Adventurous curiosity</i> is another general advantage
by which he works. This ariseth partly from a desire of knowledge,
and partly from pride; and both these make way for his design.</p>

<p>A desire after knowledge is natural, and withal very bewitching.
<i>Divinum est scire quam-plurima</i>, To know hath something in it more
than ordinary. This is noted in Job xi. 12, ‘Vain man would be
wise, though man be born like a wild ass’s colt.’ Though he be
foolish, yet he affects wisdom, and the very delight of knowing doth
engage men to curious prying searches, though with much labour and
hazard. Of this temper were the Athenians: Acts xvii. 21, ‘They
spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new
thing;’ not barely in telling news, but in inquiries after new notions
and discoveries, and this made them willing to hear Paul, as ‘a setter
forth of strange gods, and a new doctrine.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>When this desire after knowledge is animated with pride, as oft
it is, for ‘knowledge puffeth up,’ then it is more dangerous. When
men are upon a design to seem higher than others, to be singular, to
see more than what all men see, to be admired, to out-talk their
neighbours, what adventures will they not make! How fair do they
lie open to any conceit that may serve this end!</p>

<p>That Satan labours to improve this curiosity is without doubt; he
carefully affords fuel to this burning, and diligently blows it up into a
flame. The first temptation had that ingredient in it, ‘Ye shall be as
gods, knowing good and evil,’ [Gen. iii. 5.] And we see it was a great
enticement to Eve: that which would make ‘one wise’ was therefore
desirable. The blame of Israel’s first idolatry seems to be laid at this
door: Deut. xxxii. 17, ‘They sacrificed to gods whom they knew not,’
to new gods that came newly up; implying that they were drawn
aside from their old established way of worship by a curiosity to try
the new ways of the heathens. And so great a hand hath this generally
in errors, that Paul, 2 Tim. iv. 3, makes this itch after novelty
the great ground of that defection from truth which he foresaw was
coming, ‘They shall heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears,’
<i>Pruritus aurium est scabies ecclesiarum</i>. This itch of the ear is the
usual forerunner of a scab in the church, because it doth dispose men
to receive any kind of teacher. God indeed doth sometimes take the
advantage of our natural curiosity for our good. By this means many
of John’s hearers, who went out into the wilderness to him, as to a
‘strange sight,’ as those words imply, ‘What went ye out into the
wilderness to see?’ [Mat. xi. 7,] were converted. By this means,
the gospel afterwards made a large progress, as we see commonly new
teachers affect most at first; for when men grow acquainted with their
gifts, their admiration decays, and the success of their labours is not
so great many times. The devil also observing the prevalency of
curiosity, and that men are more pleased with new notions than with
old truths, he endeavours also to plough with this heifer, and oft
makes a great harvest by it. There is yet another advantage more
that he sometimes useth, and that is,</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, <i>Atheistical debauchery</i>. When men by long custom in
sinning have arrived to habitual carelessness and presumption, then
they become practical atheists. Their vicious habits work upon their
understandings to obliterate all principles. When men are gone so
far, they are fit engineers for Satan; for while they disbelieve all
things, they can, to serve a design or to head a party, take up any
opinion, and pretend the greatest seriousness in the propagating it,
though in the meantime they secretly laugh at the credulity of the
vulgar.</p>

<p>These men let out themselves and all their parts to the devil, and
he knows how to make use of them, to bring on the delusion and
deception of others. Many ages have given examples of such. Those
seducers mentioned in the New Testament were, some of them, of this
rank, and therefore called ‘deceitful workers,’ [2 Cor. xi. 13.] Such
as were not really under those persuasions which they thought to fix
upon others, but upon design, transformed themselves into the apostles
of Christ; such as served not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
bellies, and yet by good words and fair speeches deceived the hearts of
the simple: Rom. xvi. 18, ‘Who, through covetousness, with feigned
words, made merchandize of men,’ 2 Pet. ii. 3. Balaam was such,
and the woman Jezebel, that called herself a prophetess, Rev. ii. 20.
Such was the Archbishop of Spalato,<a id="FNanchor_234_234" href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> who for advantage could at
pleasure take up and lay down his religion. Such a one was the
false Jew, not so long since discovered in this place, who being a
Romish emissary, pretended to be a Jew converted; and seeking a
pure church, under that vizor, designing to overthrow, by private
insinuations, the faith of the simple, uncautious admirers!<a id="FNanchor_235_235" href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> By such
instruments Satan works where he hath opportunity.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_III_2">CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s improving these advantages for error: 1. By deluding the
understanding directly: which he doth—</i>(1.) <i>By countenancing
error from Scripture. Of his cunning therein.</i> (2.) <i>By specious
pretences of mysteries; and what these are. Of personal flatteries.
</i>(3.) <i>By affected expressions. Reason of their prevalency. </i>(4.)
<i>By bold assertions. The reasons of that policy.</i> (5.) <i>By the excellency
of the persons appearing for it, either for gifts or holiness.
His method of managing that design.</i> (6.) <i>By pretended inspiration.
</i>(7.) <i>By pretended miracles. His cunning herein.</i> (8.) <i>By
peace and prosperity in ways of error.</i> (9.) <i>By lies against truth,
and the professors of it.</i></p>


<p>What are the general advantages which Satan hath to forward his
design of error we have seen. It now remains that we take an account
of the various ways by which he improves those advantages, and those
may be referred to two heads: (1.) They are such stratagems as
more directly work upon the understanding to delude and blind it.
Or, (2.) They are such as indirectly by the power of the will and
affections do influence it.</p>

<p>1. First, Those stratagems that more immediately concern the understanding
are the use of such <i>arguments, which carry in them a probability
to confirm an error</i>, though indeed they are but fallacies,
sophisms, or paralogisms, of which the apostle speaks, Col. ii. 4, ‘Lest
any beguile you,’—that is, lest they impose upon you by ‘false reasonings.’
His usual way of proceeding in this case is:</p>

<p>(1.) First, When he hath to do with men that are brought up with
profession and belief of Scripture, he is then careful <i>to give an error
some countenance or pretence from Scripture</i>. It is not his course to
decry the Scriptures with such men, but to suppose their truth and
authority, as the most plausible way to his design; for by this means
he doth not only prevent a great many startling objections which
would otherwise rise up against him—seeing men brought up with
Scripture cannot easily be brought to call them false—but with consi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>derable
advantage lie doth thereby authorise and justify his error, for
nothing can give more boldness or confidence to a mistake than a belief
that it is backed with Scripture.</p>

<p>That this is one of his grand stratagems may be sufficiently evinced
from the infinite number of errors that pretend to Scripture warrant.
Those that are above or beyond Scripture, which acknowledge no
dependence upon it, are but few and rare, and indeed among Christians
error cannot well thrive without a pretence of Scripture. Men
would have enough to do to persuade themselves to such errors, but it
would be impossible to make a party or persuade others. Such errors
would presently be hissed out of the world. Upon this account is it
that atheism skulks and conceals itself, except where generally tolerated
profaneness gives it more than ordinary encouragement, which
is not to be ascribed to any shame-faced modesty that atheisms can be
supposed to nourish, but to the general dislike of others, who so stick
to the authority of the Bible that they reject all direct contradictions
to it with great abhorrency. Hence also it is that some erroneous
persons are forced to contradictions in their practice against their professed
principles, because they find it impossible to propagate their
errors without some pretence or other to Scripture. They that would
undermine those sacred records are forced to make use of their authority
for proof of what they would say. The papists have a quarrel at
them, and envy them the title of perfection and perspicuity, upon
design to introduce traditions, and to set up the pope’s judicial authority
in matters of faith; and when they have said all they can to subject
the Scriptures to the pope’s determination, they are forced at last
to be beholden to the Scriptures to prove the pope’s determination.
They would prove the Scriptures by the church, and then the church
by the Scriptures, which is a circle they have been often told of, and
of which some of the wiser sort among themselves are ashamed.
Others also that will not allow the Scriptures to be a general standing
rule are yet forced to make it, in some cases, a rule to themselves, and
eagerly plead it to be so to others. They that pretend to be above
ordinances, and decry outward teachings as unnecessary or hurtful,
yet they teach outwardly, because they see they are not able to enlarge
the empire of error without such teaching. Those very errors that
make it their chief business to render the Scriptures no better than an
old almanack, they yet seek to Scripture to countenance their blasphemous
assertions; and if they get any scrap or shred of it that may
by their unjust torture be wrested to speak any such thing, or anything
toward it, they think all their follies are thereby patronised, 2
Pet. iii. 16; and commonly such men either fix upon such places as
give warning of the necessary concomitances of the spirit and heart
with the outward act of service; and from hence, separating what God
hath joined together, they set up spiritual sabbaths, spiritual baptism,
spiritual worship, to cry down and cashier the external acts of such
ordinances, or they pretend kindred to Scripture, as prophesying or
foretelling those new administrations which they are about to set up.
Let H. Nicholas be an instance of this, who, though he decried the
service of the law under God the Father, and the service of the belief
under Christ, and in the room of both these would set up another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
administration under the Spirit; yet, that he might be the better believed,
he applied several scriptures to his purpose, as prophetically
foretelling H. Nicholas and his services, and would have men imagine
that he was that ‘angel flying in the midst of heaven with the everlasting
gospel,’ Rev. xiv. 6; and that prophet inquired after by the
Jews: John i. 21, ‘Art thou that prophet?’ and that ‘man ordained
to judge the world,’ Acts xvii. 31; and that the times of his dispensation
were the times of perfection and glory spoken of in 1 Cor. xiii.
9, and Heb. vi. 1. The like pretences for new administrations had
Saltmarsh and several others.</p>

<p>Satan, fixing his foot upon this design, and taking advantage of
men’s ignorance, curiosity, and pride, &amp;c., it is impossible to tell what
he may do. He hath introduced many heresies already, and none
knows what may be behind. Many passages of Scripture are dark to
the wisest of men, a great many more are so to the common sort of
Christians. A great many wits are employed by him as adventurers for
new discoveries, and a small pretence is ground enough for a bold undertaker
to erect a new notion upon; and a new notion in religion is
like a new fashion in apparel, which bewitcheth the unsteady with an
itch to be in it before they well understand what it is; so that it is
alike impossible to stint the just number of errors, as to adjust the
various pretences from Scripture upon which they may be countenanced.
Leaving, therefore, this task to those that can undertake
it, I shall only note a particular or two of Satan’s cunning in affixing
an error upon Scripture.</p>

<p>[1.] First, In any grand design of error, he endeavours <i>to lay the
foundation of it as near to truth as he can</i>; but yet so that, in the tendency
of it, it may go as far from it as may be, as some rivers, whose
first fountains are contiguous, have notwithstanding a direct contrary
course in their streams. For instance, in those errors that tend to
overthrow the doctrine of the gospel concerning Christ and ordinances—and
these are things which the devil hath a great spite at—he begins
his work with plausible pretences of love and admiration of Christ and
grace; he proceeds from thence to the pretence of purer enjoyments;
from thence to a dislike of such preachers and preaching as threaten
sin and speak out the wrath of God against iniquity, and these
are presently called legal preachers, and the doctrine of duty a legal
covenant. Having them once at this point, they easily come to immediate
assistances and special gifts, which they pretend to have above
others. Being thus set up, they are for free grace and the enjoyment
of God in spirit. From thence they come to Christian liberty, and by
degrees duties are unnecessary. There is no Christ but within them;
and being freed from the law, whatever they do is no transgression.
This is a path that Satan hath trodden of old, though now and then
he may vary in some circumstances, and be forced to stop before he
come to the utmost of his journey. You may observe this method in
the late errors of New England,<a id="FNanchor_236_236" href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> in the Familists of Germany, and in
those of Old England; in all which at the long-run men are led as far
from Scripture as darkness is from light. Now this is not only to be
seen in a progressive multiplication of errors, but often may we perceive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the same subtlety of Satan in a simple error, as when he takes up
part of a truth which should stand in conjunction with another, and
sets it up alone against its own companion, where we shall have the
name and pretence kept up, but the thing quite destroyed. God requires
services of men, and prescribes to their use prayer, hearing,
sacraments; but because in these God is dishonoured when men only
draw near with their lips, he further tell us, ‘that he is not a Jew
which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is of the
flesh,’ &amp;c., [Rom. ii. 28.] This part are some men so fixed upon, that
they think they are discharged of the other, and in practice go quite
from these duties; and yet still they profess they are for ordinances
and the worship of God. Just so are some men for Christ, but then
it is but the name, not the thing; they own Christ, they say, but then
it is Christ in them, and Christ come in their flesh, but not that Christ
that died at Jerusalem as a sacrifice for the sins of men.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Satan takes great care that an error be, in all the
ways of its propagation, <i>clothed with Scripture phrases</i>; and the less
the error can pretend to any plausible ground of Scripture, the more
doth he endeavour to adorn it with Scripture language: I understand
this chiefly of such errors as are designed for the multitude: so that
though Scripture be not used to prove the error, yet are deceivers
taught to express their conceptions by it, and to accommodate the
words and sentences of it to their purposes; for besides pride and
confidence, scriptural eloquence is a necessary ingredient to make a
powerful deluder. Observe the ringleaders of errors, and you shall
find that ordinarily such have at first been studious of the Scriptures;
and though never able to digest them, yet when they turned their ears
from truth, they have carried their Scripture language, which they had
before brought themselves unto by long custom, away with them,
and still retain it, and express their opinions by it.</p>

<p>Now this is a great advantage to Satan. For, <i>first</i>, By this means
<i>the ignorant multitude are often caught without any more ado</i>. If
they hear Scripture expressions, they are apt to think that all is truth
which is spoken by them; and they the rather believe it, because
they will imagine such teachers to be well versed in Scripture, and
consequently either so honest or so knowing that they neither can nor
will delude them. <i>Secondly</i>, There is a majesty in Scripture which, in
some sense, <i>doth stick to the very expressions of it</i>. Men may perceive
that generally hearers are more affected with Scripture eloquence than
with play-book language. It hath, as it were, a charm in the words,
which makes the ear attentive more than a quaint discourse, starched
up in the dress of common rhetoric. One gives us an observation to
that purpose of his own preaching,<a id="FNanchor_237_237" href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> and so may many others. While,
then, men hear such language, they have a reverence to it. And as physicians
cover their pills with gold that the patient might more willingly
take them, so do men often swallow down error without due consideration,
because conveyed to them in a language which they respect.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Satan’s second care for the advancement of error, after
he hath given it all the countenance he can from Scripture, is to gild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
it over with <i>specious pretences</i>. He sets it off with all the bravery he
can, and then urgeth that as an argument of its truth. Men are apt
to judge that what doth better their spiritual condition cannot be a
lie or delusion; and the argument were the more considerable, if the
advantages were such as he pretends them to be; but the very noise
and boast of advantages please the unwary, without a due inquiry into
their reality. The apostle, in Rom. xvi. 18, reduceth all this policy
of the deceiver to two heads: (1.) Good words, χρηστολογίας—words
that set out the profit and advantage of the thing; (2.) And fair
speeches, εὐλογίας—speeches that flatter the condition of the party.
His art, as to the first of these, is to tell them that the notions offered
to them are special discoveries, rare mysteries, which have been hidden
from others; and thence infers, that it must of necessity conduce much
to their happiness and spiritual perfection to know and embrace them.
Those that troubled the church in Paul’s days with false doctrines,
used this sleight of boasting, as appears by that expression in 1 Tim.
vi. 20, ‘oppositions of science.’ It seems they called their opinions,
though they were but profane and vain babblings, by the name of
‘science’ or ‘knowledge,’ implying that all others, even the apostles
themselves, were in the dark, and came short of their illumination.
The like we have in Rev. ii. 24 of that abominable prophetess Jezebel,
who recommended her blasphemous, filthy doctrines under the name
of ‘depths,’ profundities or hidden knowledge, though the Spirit of
God told that church they were not such; but if depths, they were
‘depths of Satan’—as it is added there by way of correction—and not
of the Spirit of God. We may trace these footsteps of Satan in all
considerably prevailing errors; for what hath been more common than
to hear men speak of the designs they have been carrying on under
the specious titles of Christ’s coming to set up a righteous kingdom,
the church’s coming out of Babylon and out of the wilderness, the
dawning of the day of the Lord, the day of reformation, ‘the time of
the restitution of all things,’ with abundance of brags of the same
kind? I shall add no particular instance of this nature, but a few
strains of H. Nicholas, with whom such high promising vaunts were
ordinary. His service of love he compares to the ‘most holy;’ whereas
John’s doctrine of repentance was but a preparation to the holy, and
the service of Christ he allowed to be no more than as the holy of the
temple. This his service he calls ‘the perfection of life, the completion
of prophecies, the perfect conclusion of the works of God, the
throne of Christ, the true rest of the chosen of God, the last day, the
sure word of prophecy, the new Jerusalem,’ and what not.</p>

<p>If we make further inquiry into the nature of these fair promising
mysteries, we shall find that Satan most frequently pitcheth upon these
three:—</p>

<p>[1.] <i>First</i>, He befools men into a belief that the Scriptures do, under
the veil of their words and sentences, contain <i>some hidden notions</i> that
are of purpose so disguised that they may be locked up from the
generality of men, at least from learned and wise men; and that these
rarities cannot be discerned from the usual significations of the words
and phrases, as we understand other books of the same language, but
they fancy these sacred writings to be like the writings of the Egyp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>tians,<a id="FNanchor_238_238" href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a>
by which they absconded<a id="FNanchor_239_239" href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> their mysteries, especially like that
kind of writing, whereby under words of common known sense they
intended things which the words themselves could not signify; and
that which occasions this imagination is this, that we read frequently of
‘mysteries’ in [the] Scriptures, and ‘hidden wisdom,’ and the ‘special
revelation’ of them to God’s children, which are very great truths, but
yet not to be so understood as this delusion supposeth; for these expressions
in Scripture intend no more than this, that the design of God
to save man by Christ is in itself a ‘mystery,’ which never would have
been found out without a special revelation; and that though this
‘mystery’ is now revealed by the gospel, yet as to the application of it
to the hearts of men in conversion by the operation of the Spirit, it is
yet a ‘mystery.’ But none of these intend any such suggestion, that
there are private notions of truth or doctrine that are lying under
ground, as it were, in Scripture words, which the words in the common
language will not acquaint us withal; nay, the contrary is expressly
affirmed when we are told that all is plainly laid open to the very
simple, so that from the Scriptures they may as well understand the
fundamental principles of religion, as they may understand any other
thing which their language doth express to them. However, in this
Satan takes advantage of men’s pride and curiosity to make them forward
in the acceptation of such offers, especially when such things are
represented as the only saving discoveries, which a man cannot be
ignorant of but with hazard of damnation.</p>

<p>[2.] <i>Secondly</i>, In this boast of mystery, Satan sometimes takes another
course somewhat differing from the former, and that is to put
men upon <i>allegorical reflections and allusions</i>, by which the historical
passages of Scripture are made, besides the import of the history, resemblances
of spiritual truths, which supposeth the letter of Scripture
to be true, but still as no better than the first rudiments to train up
beginners withal, yet withal that the spiritual meaning of it raiseth
the skilful to a higher form in Christ’s school. At this rate all are
turned into allegories. If they fall upon the first of Genesis, they
think they then truly understand it when they apply the light and
darkness, and God’s separating of them, with such other passages, to
the regeneration of the soul. The like work make they with the sufferings
of Christ. But then the crafty adversary at last enticeth them on to
let go the history, as if it were nothing but a parable, not really acted,
but only fitted to represent notions to us. Allegories were a trap which
the devil had for the Jews, and wherein they wonderfully pleased themselves.
How much Origen abused himself and the Scriptures by this
humour is known to many; and how the devil hath prevailed generally
by it upon giddy people in later times I need not tell you.</p>

<p>The pretence that Satan hath for this dealing is raised from some
passages of the New Testament, wherein many things of the Old Testament
are said to have had a mystical signification of things expressed
or transacted then, and some things are expressly called allegories.
Hence papists determine the Scripture to have, besides the grammatical
sense, which all of us do own, and besides the tropological sense,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
which is not diverse or distinct from the grammatical, as when from
histories we deduce instructions of holy and sober carriage, an allegorical
and analogical sense; in which dealing men consider not that
the Spirit of God his interpreting a passage or two allegorically, will
never justify any man’s boldness in presuming to do the like to any
other passage of Scripture; and beside, when any hath tried his skill
that way, another may with equal probability carry the same scripture
to a different interpretation, and by this means the Scripture shall not
only become obscure, but altogether uncertain and doubtful, and unable
to prove anything; so that this doth extremely dishonour Scripture,
by making it little less than ridiculous. Porphyry and Julian
made themselves sport with it upon the occasion of Origen’s allegorizing;
and no wonder, seeing that humour, as one calls it,<a id="FNanchor_240_240" href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> is no better
than a learned foolery. Notwithstanding this, men are sometime
transported with a strange delight in turning all into allegories, and
picking mysteries out of some by-passages and circumstances of Scripture
where one would least expect them; which I can ascribe to no
second cause more than to the working and power of fancy, which, as
it can frame ideas and images of things out of that that affords no real
likeness or proportion, as men that create to themselves similitudes
and pictures in the clouds or in the fire, so doth it please itself in its
own work; and with a kind of natural affection it doth kiss and hug
its own baby. It hath been my wonder sometimes to see how fond
men have been of their own fancies, and how extremely they have
doted upon a very bauble. I might note you examples of this, even
to nauseousness, in all studies, as well as in this of religion. Those
that affect the sublimities of chemistry do usually by a strange boldness
stretch all the sacred mysteries of Scripture, as of the Trinity, of regeneration,
&amp;c., to represent their secrets and processes, as may be seen
sufficiently in their writings. One of them I cannot forbear to name,
and that is Glauber, who doth so please himself with some idle whims
about <i>sal</i> and <i>sol</i>, that at last he falls in with Bernardinus Gomesius,
whom he cites and approves, who in this one word, ἃλς, which signifies
<i>salt</i>, finds the Trinity, the generation of the Son, the two natures
of Christ, the calling of the Jews and Gentiles, the procession of the
Spirit, and the communications of the Spirit in the law and gospel;
and all this he gathers from the shapes, strokes, and positions of these
three letters—a very subtle invention.<a id="FNanchor_241_241" href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> Not unlike to this were some
of the dotages of the Jewish Cabala, which they gathered from the
different writing of some letters in the sacred text, from the transposing
of them, and from their mystical arithmetic. R. Ellis from the
letter <i>aleph</i>, mentioned six times in Gen. i. 1, collected his notion of
the world’s continuance for six thousand years, because that letter א
stands for a thousand in the Hebrew computation. Another Rabbi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
mentioned by Lud. Cappellus,<a id="FNanchor_242_242" href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> hath a profound speculation concerning
the first letter of Genesis, which, as he saith, doth therefore begin
with <i>beth</i>, and not with <i>aleph</i>, to shew the unexceptionable verity of
God’s word, against which no mouth can justly open itself; and this
he gathers from the manner of the pronunciation of that letter ב,
which is performed by the closure of the lips. It were not possible to
imagine that wise men should be thus carried away with childish
follies, if there were not some kind of enchantment in fancy, which
makes the hit of a conceit, though never so silly, intoxicate them into
an apprehension of a rare discovery. And doubtless this is the very
thing that doth so transport the allegorizers and inventors of mysteries,
that they are ravished either with the discovery of a new nothing or
with the rare invention of an enigmatical interpretation.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, The devil hath yet another way of coining mysteries,
and that is a pretence of <i>a more full discovery of notions and ways</i>;
which, as he tells those that are willing to believe him, are but glanced
at in the Scripture; and this doth not only contain his boast of unfolding
prophecies, and the dangerous applications of them to times
and places that are no way concerned—which hath more than once put
men upon dangerous undertakings,—but also his large promise of
teaching the way of the Lord more perfectly, and of leading men into
a full comprehension of those tremendous mysteries, wherein the Scripture
hath as industriously concealed the reasons, way, and manner of
their being, as it hath fully asserted that they are: such are the decrees
of God, the Trinity, &amp;c.; as also of unfolding and teaching at
large those things that the Scripture seems only to hint at. In all
which points we have instances enough at hand which will shew us
how the devil hath played his game, either by making men bold in
things not revealed, or by drawing men to dislike solid truths, and by
puffing them up with notions, till at last they were prepared for the
impression of some grand delusion. All this while I have only explained
the first head of Satan’s specious pretences, which consists in
the promise of discoveries and mysteries—χρηστολογίαι, good words.</p>

<p>The next head of pretences are those that relate to the <i>persons</i> enamoured
with these supposed mysteries—εὐλογίαι, fair speeches. With
these he strokes their heads, and causeth them to hug themselves in
a dream of an imaginary happiness. For if they have the knowledge
of mysteries which are locked up from other men, they cannot avoid
this conclusion, that they are the only favourites of heaven, that they
only have the Spirit, are only taught of God, &amp;c. Such swelling
words of vanity have ever accompanied delusion. And indeed we
shall find the confidence of such men more strong, and their false
embracements more rapturous, than ordinarily the ways of truth do
afford, upon this account, that in such cases fancy is elevated, and the
delights of a raised fancy are excessive and enthusiastical. It is a
kind of spiritual frenzy, which extends all the faculties to an extraordinary
activity, the devil doing all he can to further it by his utmost
contributions. Joy, delight, hope, love, are all raised to make a
hubbub in the heart; whereas, on the contrary, truth is modest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
humble, sober, and affords a more silent joy, though more even and
lasting.</p>

<p>Here might I set error before you in its rant, and give you a taste
of the high-flown strains of it. Montanus, as vile as he was, had the
confidence to call himself ‘the comforter.’ Novatus and his brother
would be no less than Moses and Aaron. The Gnostics called themselves
the <i>Illuminati</i>. The Swinkfieldians assumed the title of the
Confessors of the glory of Christ. The Family of Love had their
<i>Evangelium regni</i>, the gospel of the kingdom. The <i>Fratricelli</i> distinguished
themselves from others by the term spiritual. Muntser
asserted, that all of his opinion were God’s elect, and that all the
children of their religion were to be called the children of God, and
that all others were ungodly and designed to damnation. H. Nicholas
affirms, that there was no knowledge of Christ nor Scripture, but in
his family. To this purpose most of them speak that forsake the
ways of truth; and though these swellings are but wind and vapour,
yet those heights are very serviceable to the devil’s purposes: who by
this means confirms those whom he hath already conquered, and then
fits them out with the greater confidence to allure others; and men
are apt enough to be drawn by fair shows and confident boastings.
But I proceed.</p>

<p>(3.) The third stratagem of Satan for promoting error, is to <i>astonish
men with strange language and affected expressions</i>. It was an old
device of Satan to coin an unintelligible gibberish as the proper vehicle
of strange enthusiastics’ doctrine, and this he artificially suits to his
pretended mysteries. Without this, his rare discoveries would be too
flat and dull to gain upon any man of competent understanding. For
if these dotages were clothed in plain words, they would either appear
to be direct nonsense, or ridiculous folly. It concerns him when he
hath any feats of delusion in hand, to set them off with a canting
speech, as jugglers use their hard words of <i>Ailif</i>, <i>casyl</i>, <i>zaze</i>, <i>presto</i>,
<i>millat</i>, &amp;c., to put their ignorant admirers into a belief of some
unknown power by which they do their wonders. And this is in some
sort necessary. Extraordinary matters are above expression, and such
wild expressions put men into an expectation of things sublime.
This knack Satan hath constantly used. Montanus had his strange
speeches; and all along, downward to our times, we may observe
that error hath had this gaudy dress. The Familists especially
abound with it. You may read whole books full of such a kind of
speaking, as the book called <i>Theologia Germanica</i>, or German
divinity,<a id="FNanchor_243_243" href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> the books of Jacob Behmen, ‘The Bright Morning Star,’ &amp;c.
Neither are the papists free; one of late hath taken the pains to shew
them this and other follies.<a id="FNanchor_244_244" href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> Among them you may find such talk
as this: of being ‘beclosed in the midhead of God, and in his meek-head;
of being substantially united to God, of being one’d to God; as
also of the abstractedness of life, of passive unions, of the deiform
fund of the soul; of a state of introversion; of a super-essential life,
a state of nothingness,’ &amp;c. Just like the ravings of H. Nicholas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
David George, and others, who confidently discourse of being ‘godded
with God,’ of being ‘consubstantiated with the Deity,’ and of God’s
‘being manned with them.’</p>

<p>I have oft considered what reason might be given for the takingness
of such expressions, and have been forced to satisfy myself with
these: <i>First</i>, Many mistake the knowledge of words for the knowledge
of things. And well may poor ignorant men believe they have attained,
no man knows what, by this device; when among learned men the
knowledge of words is esteemed so great a pitch of learning, and they
nourish a great many controversies that are only verbal. <i>Secondly</i>,
Some are pleased to be accounted understanders by others, and rest
in such high words as a badge of knowledge. <i>Thirdly</i>, Some are
delighted with such a hard language upon a hope that it will lead
them to the knowledge of the things at last; they think strange expressions
are a sign of deep mysteries. I knew one that set himself to
the reading of Jacob Behmen’s books, though at present he confessed
he was scarce able to make common sense of three lines together,
upon a secret enticement that he had from the language, to come to
some excellent discovery by much pains and reading. <i>Fourthly</i>,
Some that have their fancies heated, have by this means broken, confused
impressions of strange things in their imaginations, and conceive
themselves to know things beyond what common language can express:
as if with Paul, rapt up into the third heaven, ‘they hear and see
wonders unutterable.’ But what reason soever prevails with men to
take up such a way of speaking, Satan makes them believe that it
contains a rich mine or treasury, not of common truths, but of extraordinary
profundities.<a id="FNanchor_245_245" href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, Instead of argument to confirm an error, sometimes
we have only <i>bold assertions that it is truth, and a confident condemning
the contrary as an error</i>, urging the danger of men’s rejecting it,
backed with threatening of hell and damnation; and all this in the
Words of Scripture. To be sure, they are right, and all other men
are wrong. This kind of confidence and fierceness hath been still the
complexion of any remarkable way of delusion; for that commonly
confines their charity to their own party, which is a great token of an
error. Not only may you observe in such extraordinary proclamations
of wrath against those that will not believe them: a practice used by
the mad fanatics of Munster, who, as our Quakers were wont to do,
go up and down the streets, crying, ‘Wo, wo; repent, repent; come
out of Babylon; the heavy wrath of God; the axe is laid to the root
of the tree;’ but in their more settled teaching they pronounce all to
be antichrist, and of the carnal church, that do oppose them. Take
for this H. Nicholas his words: ‘all knowledge’ besides his, ‘is but
witchery and blindness, and all other teachers and learners are a false
Christianity, and the devil’s synagogue; a nest of devils and wicked
spirits; a false being, the antichrist, the kingdom of hell, the majesty
of the devil,’ &amp;c. This piece of art, not only our Quakers, to whom
nothing is more familiar than to say to any opposer, ‘Thou art
damned, thou art in the gall of bitterness, the lake of fire and brim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>stone
is prepared for thee,’ &amp;c., but also the papists commonly practise,
who shut all out of heaven that are not of their church; and
when they would affright any from protestantism, they make not
nice to tell him that there is no possibility of salvation but in their
way.</p>

<p>The reasons of this policy are these: (1.) The heart is apt to be
startled with threatenings, and moved by commands; especially those
that are of a more tender and frightful spirit; and though they
know nothing by themselves, yet these beget fears which may secretly
betray reason, and make men leave the right way because of affrightment.
(2.) The confidence of the assertors of such things hath also
its prevalency; for men are apt to think that they would not speak
so if they were not very certain, and had not real experience of what
they said, and thus are men threaped<a id="FNanchor_246_246" href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> out of their own persuasions.
(3.) The native majesty of Scripture, in a business of so great hazard,
adds an unexpressible force to such threatenings; and though, being
misapplied, they are no more Scripture threatenings, yet, because
God hath spoken his displeasure in those words, men are apt to revere
them—as men cannot avoid to fear a serpent or toad, though they
know the sting and poison were taken out, because nature did furnish
them with a sting or venom.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, It is a usual trick of Satan to <i>derive a credit and
honour to error, from the excellencies, supposed or real, of the persons
that more eminently appear for it</i>. So that it fetcheth no small
strength from the qualities of those that propagate it. The vulgar,
that do not usually dive deep into the natures of things, content themselves
with the most superficial arguments, and are sooner won to a
good conceit of any opinion by the respects they carry to the author,
than by the strongest demonstration.</p>

<p>The excellencies that usually move them are either their gifts or
their holiness. If the seedsman of an error be learned, or eloquent
and affectionate in his speaking, men are apt to subscribe to anything
he shall say, from a blind devotional<a id="FNanchor_247_247" href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> admiration of the parts wherewith
he is endowed. And often, where there is no learning, or where
learning is decried, as savouring too much of man, if there be natural
fluency of speech, with a sufficient measure of confidence, it raiseth
them so much the higher in the esteem of the common sort, who
therefore judge him to be immediately taught of God, and divinely
furnished with gifts. At this point began the divisions of the church
of Corinth. They had several officers severally gifted; some were
taken with one man’s gift, others with another man’s; some are for
Paul, as being profound and nervous in his discourses; others for
Apollos, as eloquent; a third sort were for Cephas, as, suppose,
an affectionate preacher. Thus upon personal respects were they
divided into parties: and if these several teachers were of different
opinions, their adherents embraced them upon an affectionate conceit
of their excellencies. And generally Satan hath wrought much by
such considerations as these. This he urgeth against Christ himself,
when he set up the wisdom and learning of the rulers and pharisees,
as an argument of truth in their way of rejecting such a Messias: John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
vii. 48, ‘Have any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him?’
There is no insinuation more frequent than this: these are learned,
excellent, able men, and therefore what they say or teach is not to be
disbelieved; and though this be but <i>argumentum stultum</i>, a foolish
argument, yet some that would be accounted wise do make very
great use of it. The crack<a id="FNanchor_248_248" href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> ‘of learned doctors among the papists’ is
one topic of persuasion to popery, and so to other errors, as appears
by this, that all errors abound with large declamations of the praises
of their founders and teachers: and the most illiterate errors usually
magnify the excellent inspirements and gifts of utterance of their
leaders.</p>

<p>But the other excellency of holiness in the teachers of error is more
generally and more advantageously improved by Satan, to persuade
men that all is true doctrine which such men profess. Of this delusion
Christ forewarned us, ‘They shall come in sheep’s clothing—that
is, under the mask of seeming holiness, at least at first; notwithstanding,
‘beware of them,’ Mat. vii. 15. Those complained of
by Paul, 2 Cor. xi. 15, though they were Satan’s ministers, yet that
they and their doctrine might be more plausibly entertained, they
were ‘transformed as the ministers of righteousness.’ This cunning
we may espy in heretics of all ages. The Scribes and Pharisees
used a pretence of sanctity as a main piece of art to draw others to
their way. Their alms, fastings, long prayers, strict observations, &amp;c.,
were all designed as a net to catch the multitude withal. The lying
doctrines of Antichrist were foretold by Paul, to have their success
from this stratagem; all that idolatry and heathenism which he is to
introduce must be, and hath been, through the hypocrisy of a painted
holiness, 1 Tim. iv. 2; and where he intends most to play the dragon,
Rev. xiii. 11, he there most artificially counterfeits the innocency
and simplicity of the lamb. Arch-heretics have been arch-pretenders
to sanctity, and such pretences have great influence upon men; for
holiness and truth are so near of kin, that they will not readily believe
that it can be a false doctrine which a holy man teacheth. They
think that God that hath given a teacher holiness will not deny him
truth. Nay, this is an easy and plausible measure which they have
for truth and error. To inquire into the intricacies and depths of a
disputation is too burdensome and difficult for ordinary men, and
therefore they satisfy themselves with this consideration, which hath
little toil in it, and as little certainty: that surely God will not
leave holy men to a delusion. It would be endless to give all the
instances that are at hand in this matter. I shall only add a few
things of Satan’s method in managing this argument, as,</p>

<p>[1.] First, When he hath a design of common or prevailing delusion,
he mainly endeavours <i>to corrupt some person of a more strict,
serious, and religious carriage, to be the captain and ringleader</i>;
such men were Pelagius, Arius, Socinus, &amp;c. He mainly endeavours
to have fit instruments. If he be upon that design of blemishing
religion, and to bring truth into a disesteem, then, as one observes,<a id="FNanchor_249_249" href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>
he persuades such into the ministry as he foresees are likely to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
idle, careless, profane, and scandalous; or doth endeavour to promote
such ministers into more conspicuous places, and provokes them to
miscarriage, that so their example may be an objection against truth,
while in the meantime he is willing that the opposers of truth should
continue their smooth carriage; and then he puts a two-edged sword
into the hands of the unstable: Can that be truth where there is
so much wickedness? and can this be error where there is so much
holiness?</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, In prosecution of this design he usually puts men
upon some more than <i>ordinary strictness, that the pretence of holiness
may be the more augmented</i>. In this case a course of ordinary sanctity
is not enough, they must be above the common practice; some singular
additions of severity and exactness above what is written, are commonly
affected to make them the more remarkable. Christ notes
this in the Pharisees, concerning all their devotions, and the ways of
expressing them; their phylacteries spoken of, Mat. xxiii. 5, as some
think,<a id="FNanchor_250_250" href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> were not intended by that text of Deut. vi. 8, but only that
they should remember the law, and endeavour not to forget it, as they
do that tie a thread or such like thing about their finger for a remembrancer;
according to Prov. iii. 3, ‘Bind them about thy neck,
write them upon the table of thine heart.’ However, if they were
literally enjoined, they would have them, as Christ tells them, broader
than others, as an evidence of their greater care. The <i>Cathari</i>
boasted of sanctity and good works, and rejected second marriages;
the <i>Apostolici</i> were so called from a pretended stricter imitation of
the singular holiness of the apostles. The <i>Valesians</i> made themselves
eunuchs, according to the letter, ‘for the kingdom of God.’ The
<i>Donatists</i> accounted that no true church where any spot or infirmity
was found. The <i>Messalians</i>, or <i>Euchytæ</i>, were for constant praying,
the <i>Nudipedales</i> for going barefoot, &amp;c. The papists urge canonical
hours, whippings, penances, pilgrimages, voluntary poverty, abstinence
from meats and marriage in their priests and votaries. In a
word, all noted sects have something of special singularity, whereby
they would difference themselves from others, as a peculiar character
of their greater strictness; and for want of better stuff they sometimes
take up affected gestures, devotional looks, and outward garbs;
all which have this note, that what they most stand upon, God hath
least, or not at all, required at their hands—their voluntary humility,
or neglecting of the body being but will-worship, and a self-devised
piece of religion.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, When once men are set in the way of exercising
severities, Satan endeavours, by working upon their fancies, to <i>press
them on further to a delight and satisfaction in these</i><a id="FNanchor_251_251" href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> ways of strictness,
so that the practisers themselves are not only confirmed in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
usages, and the opinions that are concomitant with them, but others
are the more easily drawn to like and profess the same things. Any
serious temper, under any profession of religion, easily comes to be
devout, and readily complies with opportunities of evincing its devotion
by strictness. And therefore we shall find among heathens a
great devotional severity, and such as far exceeds all of that kind
which the papists do usually brag of. The Magi abstained from
wine, ate not the flesh of living creatures, and professed virginity.
The Indian Brachmans did the like, and besides used themselves to
incredible hardship; they laid upon skins, sustained the violence of
the sun and storms, and exercised themselves therewith; some spending
thirty-seven years in this course, others more. We read strange
things of this nature concerning the Egyptian priests, and others.
The Mohammedans are not without their religious orders, which pretend
a more holy and austere life than others; and though of some,
as of the <i>torlachs</i> and <i>dervizes</i>, several private villainies are reported,
yet of others, as of the order of <i>calender</i>, we are assured from history
that they profess virginity, and expose themselves to hardship, and a
stricter devotion in their way; and generally it is said of all of them,
that they go meanly clad, or half naked; some abstinent in eating
and drinking, professing poverty, renouncing the world. Some can
endure cutting and slashing, as if they were insensible; some profess
perpetual silence, though urged with injuries and tortures;
others have chains about their necks and arms, to shew that they are
bound up from the world, &amp;c. If such things may be found among
heathens, no wonder that error boasts of them, for in both there is
the same reason of men’s pleasing themselves in such hardships,
which is from a natural devotion, assisted by Satan’s cunning, and
the same design driven on by it; for the devil doth confirm heathens
and Mohammedans in their false worship by the reverence and respect
they carry to such practices.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Because religious holiness hath a beauty in it, and is
very lovely, he doth all he can <i>to affect men with the highest reverence
for these pretences of religious strictness</i>; so that they that will not
be at pains to practise them, can bestow an excessive respect and
admiration upon those that are grown famous in the use of such
things; and by that means being almost adored, they are without
doubt persuaded that all they teach or do is right, and in a doting
fondness they multiply superstitious errors. Idolatry is supposed to
have a great part of its rise from this. While men endeavoured to
express their thankful and admiring remembrances of some excellent
persons by setting up their pictures, their posterity began to worship
them as gods. Pilgrimages were first set on foot by the respects that
men gave to places that were made famous by persons and actions
of more than ordinary holiness;<a id="FNanchor_252_252" href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> and because the devil found men so
very apt to please themselves in paying such devotional reverences, he
wrought upon their superstitious humour to multiply to themselves
the occasions thereof, and by fabulous traditions sent them to places
no otherwise made memorable than by dreams and impostures. Much
of this you might see if you would accompany a caravan from Cairo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
to Mecca and Medina, where you would see the zealous pilgrims, with
a great many orisons and prayers, compassing Abraham’s house, kissing
a stone which, they are told, fell from heaven; blessing themselves
with a relic of the old vesture of Abraham’s house, washing themselves
in the pond, which, as their tradition goes, the angel shewed to
Hagar; saluting the mountain of pardon, throwing stones in defiance
of the devil, as their legend tells them Ishmael did; their prayers on
the mountain of health, their visit to the prophet’s tomb at Medina,
&amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_253_253" href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> The like might you observe among the papists, in their pilgrimages
to Jerusalem and the sepulchre, to the Lady of Loretto’s
chapel, and other places. By such devices as these the unobservant
people are transported with a pleasure, insomuch that they
not only persuade themselves they are very devout in these reverences,
but they also become unalterably fixed to these errors that
do support these delightful practices, or as consequences do issue
from them.</p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, A more plausible argument for error than the learning
and holiness of the persons that profess it, is that of <i>inspiration</i>, in
which the devil soars aloft and pretends the highest divine warrant
for his falsehoods; for ‘God is truth,’ and ‘we know that no lie is of
the truth.’ Now to make men believe that God by his Holy Spirit
doth in any manner dictate such opinions, or certainly reveal such
things for truths, is one of the highest artifices that he can pretend to,
and such a confirmation must it be to those that are so persuaded,
that all disputes and doubtings must necessarily be silenced.</p>

<p>That the devil can thus ‘transform himself into an angel of light,’
we are assured from Scripture, which hath particularly cautioned us
against this cheat. The apostasy of the later times, 1 Tim. iv. 1, the
apostle foretells should be carried on by the prevalency of this pretence:
‘Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
spirits.’ That by ‘spirits’ there, doctrines are intended rather than
doctors, is Mr Mede’s interpretation;<a id="FNanchor_254_254" href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> but it will come all to one if
we consider that the word ‘spirit’ carries more in it than either doctrine
or doctor; for to call either the one or the other ‘a spirit’ would
be intolerably harsh, if it were not for this, that that ‘doctor’ is hereby
supposed to pretend an infallibility from the Spirit of God, or,
which is all one, that he received his doctrine by some immediate revelation
of the Spirit; so that by ‘seducing spirits’ must be men or
doctrines that seduce others to believe them, by the pretence of the
Spirit or inspiration; and that text of 1 John iv. 1 doth thus explain
it: ‘Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God,’
which is as much as if he had said, Believe not every man or doctrine
that shall pretend he is sent of God and hath his Spirit; and the reason
there given makes it yet more plain, because many ‘false prophets
are gone out into the world;’ so that these ‘spirits’ are ‘false prophets,’
men that pretend inspiration. And the warning, ‘Believe not
every spirit,’ tells us that Satan doth with such a dexterity counterfeit
the Spirit’s inspirations, that holy and good men are in no small hazard
to be deceived thereby. Most full to this purpose is that of 2 Thes. ii. 2,
‘That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at
hand;’ where the several means of seduction are particularly reckoned
as distinct from the doctrine and doctors, and by ‘spirit’ can be meant
no other than a pretence of inspiration or revelation.<a id="FNanchor_255_255" href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>It is evident then that Satan by this artifice useth to put a stamp
of divine warrant upon his adulterate coin; and if we look into his
practice, we shall in all ages find him at this work. Among heathens
he frequently gained a repute to his superstitious idolatrous worship
by this device. The men of greatest note among them feigned a
spiritual commerce with the gods. Empedocles endeavoured to make
the people believe that there was a kind of divinity in him, and
affecting to be esteemed more than a man, cast himself into the burnings
of Mongebel, that they might suppose him to have been taken
up to the gods.<a id="FNanchor_256_256" href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> Pythagoras his fiction of a journey to hell was upon
the same account. Philostratus and Cedrenus report no less of Apollonius,
than that he had familiar converses with their supposed deities;
and the like did they believe of their magi and priests; insomuch that
some cunning politicians, observing how the vulgar were under a deep
reverence to such pretences, gave it out that they had received their
laws by divine inspirations. Numa Pompilius feigned he received his
institutions from the nymph Ægeria, Lycurgus from Apollo; Minos the
lawgiver of Candia boasted that Jupiter was his familiar. Mohammed
also speaks as high this way as any; his Alcoran must be no less than
a law received from God, and to that end he pretends a strange journey
to heaven, and frequent converse with the angel Gabriel.</p>

<p>If we trace Satan in the errors which he hath raised up under the
profession of the Scriptures, we may observe the same method. The
Valentinians, Gnostics, Montanists talked as confidently of the Spirit
as Moses or the prophets could do, and a great deal more; for some
of them blasphemously called themselves the Paraclete or Comforter.
Among the monsters which later ages produced, we still find the same
strain: one saith he is Enoch, another styles himself the ‘great prophet,’
another hath raptures, and all immediately inspired. The
papists have as much of this cheat among them as any other; and
some of their learned defenders avouch their <i>lumen propheticum</i>, and
<i>miraculorum gloria</i>, prophesies and miracles, to be the two eyes, or
the sun and moon of their church; nay, by a strange transportment
of folly, to the forfeiture of the reputation of learning and reason, they
have so multiplied revelations that we have whole volumes of them, as
the revelations of their St Bridget and others; and by wonderful
credulity they have not only advanced apparent dreams and dotages
to the honour of inspirations or visions, but upon this sandy foundation
they have built a great many of their doctrines, as purgatory,
transubstantiation, auricular confession, &amp;c. By such warrants have
they instituted festivals and founded several orders. The particulars
of these things you may see more at large in Dr Stillingfleet and
others. And that there might be nothing wanting that might make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
them shamelessly impudent, they are not content to equal their
fooleries with the Scriptures of God, as that the rule of their St.
Francis—for I shall only instance in him, omitting others for brevity
sake—was not composed by the wisdom of man, but by God himself,
and inspired by the Holy Ghost, but they advance their prophets
above the apostles, and above Christ himself. Their St Benedict, if
you will believe them, was rapt up to the third heavens, where he
saw God face to face, and heard the choir of angels; and their St.
Francis was a nonsuch for miracles and revelations. Neither may we
wonder that Satan should be forward in urging this cheat, when we
consider,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>What a reverence men naturally carry to revelations,
and how apt they are to be surprised with a hasty credulity</i>. An old
prophecy, pretended to be found in a wall, or taken out of an old
manuscript, of I know not what uncertain author, is usually more
doted on than the plain and infallible rules of Scripture. This we may
observe daily; and foreigners do much blame the English for a facile
belief of such things; but it is a general fault of mankind, and we
find even wise men forward in their persuasions upon meaner grounds
than those that gain credit to old prophecies. For their antiquity
and strangeness of discovery, especially at such times wherein the
present posture of affairs seem to favour such predictions with a probability
of such events, are more likely to get credit than these artificial
imitations of the ways and garbs of the old prophets, and the
cunning legerdemain of those that pretend to inspirations by seeming
ecstasies, raptures, and confident declarations, &amp;c.; nevertheless arrant
cheats have by these ways deceived no mean men. Alvarus acknowledgeth
that he honoured a woman as a saint that had visions and
raptures as if really inspired—and the same apprehensions had the
bishop and friars—who was afterward discovered to be a naughty
woman.<a id="FNanchor_257_257" href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> Who shall then think it strange that the unobservant
multitude should be deluded by such an art?</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Especially if we consider that <i>God himself took this
course to signify his mind to men</i>. His prophets were divinely inspired,
and the Scriptures were not of ‘any private interpretation,’
ἰδίας ἐπιλύσεως. The words that the penmen of Scriptures wrote
were not the interpretations of their own private thoughts, ‘for the
prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of
God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,’ 2 Pet. i. 20, 21.
Now though the prophecies of Scripture are sealed, and no more is to
be added to them upon any pretence whatsoever, yet seeing there are
promises left us of the ‘giving of the Spirit,’ of ‘being taught and led
by the Spirit,’ it is an easy matter for Satan to beguile men into an
expectation of prophetic inspirations, and a belief of what is pretended
so to be; for all men do not or will not understand that these promises
of the Spirit have no intendment of new and extraordinary immediate
revelations, but only of the efficacious applications of what is
already revealed in Scripture. This kind of revelation we acknowledge
and teach, which is far enough from enthusiasm, that is, a pretended
revelation of new truths, and we have reason to assert that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
internal persuasions without the external word are to be avoided as
Satan’s cozenages.<a id="FNanchor_258_258" href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> But for all this, when men’s minds are set agadding,
if they meet with such as magnify their own dreams, and
call their fancies visions, the suitableness of this to their humour
makes them to reject our interpretations of these promises as false,
and to persuade themselves that they are to be understood of such
inspirations as the prophets of old had; and then they presently conclude
they are to believe them, lest otherwise they should resist the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, But <i>the advantage which the devil hath to work delusion
upon by this pretence is a high motive to him to practise upon
it</i>. For inspirations, visions, voices, impulses, dreams, and revelations
are things wherein wicked impostors may by many ways and artifices
play the counterfeits undiscovered. It is easy to prophesy false
dreams, and to say, thus saith the Lord, when yet they do but lie, and
the Lord never sent them nor commanded them, Jer. xxiii. 31; nay,
it is easy, by tricks and illusions, to put that honour and credit upon
their designs which they could not by their bare assertions, backed
with all their art of seeming seriousness. The inventions of men that
have been formerly successful in this deceit being now laid open to our
knowledge, may make us more wary in our trust. Among the
heathens you may find notable ways of deceits of this nature. The
story of Hanno and Psappho is commonly known; they tamed birds
and learned them to speak, ‘Hanno and Psappho are gods,’ and then
set them at liberty, that men hearing such strange voices in the woods
from birds, might imagine that these men were declared gods by
special discovery. Mohammed’s device of making a dove to come frequently
to his ear, which he did by training her up to a use of picking
corn out of it, served him for an evidence among the vulgar beholders,
who knew not the true cause of it, of his immediate inspiration
by the angel Gabriel, who, as he told them, whispered in his ear
in the shape of a dove. The like knavery he practised for the confirmation
of the truth of his Alcoran, by making a bull, taught before to
come at a call or sign, to come to him with a chapiter upon his horns.
Hector Boetius tells us of a like stratagem of a king of Scots, who, to
animate his fainting subjects against the Picts that had beaten them,
caused a man clothed in the shining skins of fishes, and with rotten
wood, which, as a glow-worm in the night, represents a faint light, to
come among them in the dark, and through a reed or hollow trunk,
that the voice might not appear to be human, to incite them to a
vigorous onset: this they took to be an angel bringing them this command
from heaven, and accordingly fought and prevailed. Crafty
Benedict, who was afterward pope under the name of Boniface VIII.,
made simple Celestine V. give over the popedom by conveying to him
a voice through a reed to this purpose: Celestine, Celestine, renounce
the papacy, give it over, if thou wouldst be saved, the burden is beyond
thy strength, &amp;c. The silly man, taking this for a revelation
from heaven, quitted his chair and left it for that crafty fox Benedict.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Not very many years since the same trick was played in this country
to a man of revelations—Paul Hobson—who called himself David in
spirit. When he had wearied his entertainer with a long stay, he
quitted himself of his company, as I was credibly informed, by a policy
which he perceived would well suit with the man’s conceitedness, for
through a reed in the night-time he tells him that he must go into
Wales, or some such country, and there preach the gospel; the next
morning the man avouches a revelation from God to go elsewhere, and
so departs. These instances shew you how cunningly a cheating knave
may carry on a pretence of revelation or vision. And yet this is not
all the advantage which the devil hath in this matter, though it is an
advantage which he sometime makes use of when he is fitted with
suitable instruments. But he works most dangerously when he so
acts upon men that they themselves believe they have visions, raptures,
and revelations, for some are really persuaded that it is so with them.
Neither is it strange that men should be deluded into an apprehension
that they hear and see what they do not; in fevers, frenzies, and madness
we clearly see it to be so; and who can convince such persons of
their mistakes, when with as high a confidence as may be they contend
that they are not deceived? Shall we think it strange that Satan
hath ways of conveying false apprehensions upon men’s minds? No,
surely. Do we not see that the senses may be cheated, and that the
fancies of men may be corrupted? Is it not easy for him to convey
voices to the ear, or shapes and representations to the eye? and in
such cases, what can ordinarily hinder a belief that they hear or see
such things? But he needs not always work upon the fancy by the
senses. If he hath the advantage of a crazy distempered fancy, as
commonly he hath in melancholy persons, he can so strongly fix his
suggestions upon them, and so effectually set the fancy on work to
embrace them, that without any appearance of madness they will persuade
themselves that they have discoveries from God, impulses by
his Spirit, scriptures set upon their hearts, and what not; and because
they feel the workings of these things within them, it is impossible to
make them so much as suspect that they are deceived. Do but consider
the power of any fancy in a melancholic person, and you may
easily apprehend how Satan works in such delusions. Melancholy
doth strangely pervert the imagination, and will beget in men wonderful
misapprehensions, and that sometimes doth bewitch them into
peremptory, uncontrollable belief of their fancy. It is a vehement,
confident humour, what way soever it takes; the imagination thus
corrupted hath an enormous strength, so that if it fix upon things
never so absurd or irrational, it is not reducible by the strongest reasons.
If such a man conceits himself dead, or that he is transformed
to a wolf or cat, or that he is made of glass, as many in this distemper
have done, there is no persuasion to the contrary that can take place
with him. Now if this humour be taken up with divine matters, as
usually it doth, for it hath a natural inclination to religious things, it
still acts with fierceness and confidence, and there are many things
often concomitant to such actings, that if it misconceit inspiration or
prophecy, the parties themselves are not only bound up under that
persuasion, but even unwary spectators are deluded. For sometime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
a melancholy imagination is not wholly corrupt, but only in respect of
some one or two particulars, whilst in other things it acts regularly,
and then neither they nor others, that are unacquainted with such
cases, are so apt to suspect that they are mistaken in these things,
while they act rationally and soberly in other matters. Sometime
they have vehement fits of surprisal—for the humour hath its ebbings
and flowings—and this gives them occasion to apprehend that something
doth supernaturally act or raise them, and then when the things
they speak are for the matter of them of religious concern and odd
notions—for the humour flies high and bounds not itself with ordinary
things—and withal uttered in Scripture rhetoric and with fervency
and urgency of spirit—when these things concur, there is such an appearance
of inspiration that the parties themselves and others rest
fully persuaded that it is so.</p>

<p>(7.) Seventhly, <i>Pretended and counterfeit miracles the devil makes
much use of to countenance error, and this is also one of his strongholds</i>;
for he suggests that God himself bears witness by these signs,
wonders, and miracles to such erroneous doctrine as seems to be concerned<a id="FNanchor_259_259" href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>
by them.</p>

<p>That the devil cannot work a true miracle hath been discoursed
before, but that he can perform many strange things, and such as may
beget admiration, none denies; and that by such unwonted actions he
usually endeavours to justify false doctrines, and to set them off with
the appearance of divine approbation, we are sufficiently forewarned in
the Scriptures.<a id="FNanchor_260_260" href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses by false miracles.
In Deut. xiii. 1, God speaks of the signs and wonders of false prophets,
who would by that means seek to seduce the people to follow after
other gods. Christ also, in Mat. xxiv. 24, foretells that ‘false Christs
and false prophets shall arise, and shew great signs and wonders, insomuch
that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect,’ and
puts a special note of caution upon it: ‘Behold, I have told you before.’
And to the same purpose is that of Paul concerning Antichrist,
2 Thes. ii. 9, where he tells us of powerful ‘signs and wonders by the
working of Satan,’ who doth all the while only lie and cheat that he
may draw men to error.</p>

<p>If we make inquiry how Satan hath managed this engine, we shall
observe not only his diligence in using it on all occasions to countenance
all kind of errors both in paganism and Christianity, but also
his subtle dexterity by cheating men with forgeries and falsehood.</p>

<p>Heathenish idolatry, among other helps for its advancement, wanted
not this. The oracles and responses, which were common before the
coming of Christ, were esteemed as miraculous confirmations of the
truth of the deities which they worshipped; the movings and speakings
of their statues<a id="FNanchor_261_261" href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> were arguments that the operative presence of
some celestial <i>Numen</i> was affixed to such an image. In some places
the solemn sacrifices are never performed without a seeming miracle.
As in Nova Zembla, where the priest’s trances, his running a sword<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
into his belly, his making his head and shoulder fall off his body into
a kettle of hot water by the drawing of a line, and then his reviving
again perfect and entire, without maim or hurt, are all strange, astonishing
things to the beholders.<a id="FNanchor_262_262" href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> But besides such things as these,
which are standing constant wonders, we read of some that have had,
as it were, a gift of miracles, that they might be eminently instrumental
to promote and honour paganism. All histories agree that Simon
Magus did so many strange things at Rome—as the causing an image
to walk, turning stones into bread, transforming himself into several
shapes, flying in the air, &amp;c.—that he was esteemed a god. Philostratus
and Cedrenus<a id="FNanchor_263_263" href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> report great things of Apollonius [of Tyana,]
as that he could deliver cities from scorpions, serpents, earthquakes,
&amp;c., and that many miracles were wrought by him. This man Satan
raised up in an extraordinary manner to revive the honour of paganism,
that it might at least vie with Christianity. And though few
ever attained to that height which Apollonius and Simon Magus
reached unto, yet have we several instances of great things done now
and then by some singular persons upon a special occasion, which
Satan improved to his advantage. Vespasian cured a lame and blind
man.<a id="FNanchor_264_264" href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> Adrianus cured a blind woman; and which is more, after he
was dead, by the touch of his body, a man of Pannonia who was born
blind received his sight.<a id="FNanchor_265_265" href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> Valerius Maximus tells of many strange
things, and particularly of a vestal virgin that drew water into a sieve.
As Livy tells of another, Claudia by name, who with her girdle drew
the ship to the shore which carried the mother of their gods, when
neither strength of men nor oxen could do it.<a id="FNanchor_266_266" href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<p>Errors under profession of Christianity have been supported and
propagated by the boast of miracles. A clear instance for this we
have in popery, that religion being a perpetual boast of wonders. To
let pass their great miracle of transubstantiation, which, as one hath
lately demonstrated, is a bundle of miracles, or contradictions rather,<a id="FNanchor_267_267" href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>
because it appears not to the senses of any man, and consequently is
not capable of being an argument to prove any of their opinions. We
have abundance of strange things related by them, as proofs of some
doctrines of theirs in particular, as purgatory, invocation of saints,
transubstantiation, &amp;c., and of their profession in the general, devils
cast out, blind and lame cured, dead raised, and what not; it would
be endless to recite particulars. It would take a long time to tell
what their St Francis hath done—how he fetched water out of a rock,
how he was homaged by fowls and fishes, how he made a fountain
in Marchia run wine, and how far he exceeded Christ himself in
wonderful feats. Christ did nothing which St Francis did not do,
nay, he did many more things than Christ did: Christ turned water
into wine but once, but St Francis did it thrice; Christ was once
transfigured, but St Francis twenty times; he and his brethren
raised above a thousand to life, cast out more than a thousand devils,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
&amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_268_268" href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> Their Dominicus raised three dead men to life. Their Zeverius,<a id="FNanchor_269_269" href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a>
while he was alive, did many miracles, and after he was
dead his body lay fifteen months sweetly smelling, without any taint
of corruption. It is irksome to repeat their stories; abundance of
such stuff might be added out of their own writings, the design of
all which is to prove, to those that are so prodigal of their faith as
to believe them, that they only are the true church, and that by this
note among others they may be known to be so.</p>

<p>But let us turn aside a little to observe Satan’s cunning in this
pretence of miracles; let things be soberly weighed, and we may see
enough of the cheat. This great boast is, as Austin hath it, resolved
into one of these two—either the figments of lying men, or the craft of
deceitful spirits: <i>Vel figmenta hominum mendacium, vel portenta
fallacium spirituum</i>.</p>

<p>As to the first of these, it is evident that a great many things that
have been taken by the vulgar for mighty wonders, were nothing but
the knaveries of impostors, who in this matter have used a threefold
cunning.</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>By mere juggling and forgery in confederacies and private
contrivances they have set upon the stage persons before instructed
to act their parts, or things aforehand prepared, to pretend to be what
they were not, that others might seem to do what they did not, and all
to amaze those that know not the bottom of the matter</i>. Of this nature
was Mohammed’s dove and bull, who were privately trained up to that
obedience and familiarity which they used to him. The pagan priests
were not altogether to seek in this piece of art. Lucian tells us of one
Alexander, who nourished and tamed a serpent, and made the people
of Pontus believe that it was the god Æsculapius, and doubtless the
idol priests improved their private artificial contrivances: as of the
movings of their images, as that of Venus made by Dædalus, which by
the means of quicksilver enclosed could stir itself;<a id="FNanchor_270_270" href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> their eating and
drinking, as in the story of Bel in the Apochryphal adjections to the
Book of Daniel; their responses, and several other appearances; as of
the paper head of Adonis or Osiris, which, as Lucian reports, comes
swimming down the river every year from Egypt to Byblos, &amp;c.;
these and such like they improved as evidences of the power, knowledge,
and reality of their gods. And though in the prevalency of
idolatry, where there was no considerable party to oppose, their cheats
were not always discovered, yet we have no reason to imagine that the
priests of those days were so honest that they were only deceived by
the devil’s craft, and did not in a villainous design purposely endeavour
the delusion of others. If we had no other grounds for a just
suspicion in these cases, the famous instances of the abuse of Paulina
at the temple of Isis in Rome, in the reign of the emperor Tiberius,
by the procurement of Mondus, who corrupted the priest of Anubis to
signify to her the love of their god, and under that coverture gratified
the lust of Mondus, mentioned by Josephus.<a id="FNanchor_271_271" href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> And that of Tyrannus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
priest of Saturn in Alexandria, who by the like pretence of the love
of Saturn, adulterated most of the fairest dames of the city, mentioned
by Ruffinus.<a id="FNanchor_272_272" href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> These would sufficiently witness that the priests of
those times were apt enough to abuse the people at the rate we have
been speaking of. In popery nothing hath been more ordinary. Who
knows not the story of the holy maid of Kent and the boy of Bilson?
How common is it with them to play tricks with women troubled
with hysterical distempers; and to pretend the casting out of devils,
when they have only to deal with a natural disease. Not very many
years since they practised upon a poor young woman at Durham, and
made great boasts of their exorcisms, relics, and holy water against
the devil, with whom they would have all believe she was possessed,
when the event discovered that her fits were only the fits of the
mother. I myself, and some others in this place, have seen those fits
allayed by the fume of tobacco blown into her mouth, to the shame
and apparent detection of that artifice. I might mention the legerdemain
of Antonius of Padua, who made his horse adore the host, for
the conversion of a heretic; the finding of the images of St Paul and
St Dominic in a church at Venice, with this inscription for Paul,
‘By this man you may come to Christ;’ and this for Dominic, ‘But
by this man you may do it easilier;’ and the honour put upon Garnet,
by his image on straw,<a id="FNanchor_273_273" href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> found at his execution, in all probability by
him that made it and threw it down, or by his confederate: but these
are enough to shew the honesty of these kind of men.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>They have also a cunning of ascribing effects to
wrong causes, and by that means they make those things wonders that
are none</i>. Mohammed called his fits of falling-sickness ecstasies or
trances. Austin tells us the heathens were notable at this: the burning
lamp in the temple of Venus, though only the work of art, was
interpreted to be a constant miracle of that deity.<a id="FNanchor_274_274" href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> The image which,
in another temple, hung in the air, by ignorant gazers was accounted
a wonder, when indeed the loadstone in the roof and pavement, though
unseen, was the cause of it. The Sidonians were confirmed in their
constant annual lamentations of Adonis, by a mock miracle of the
redness of the river Adonis at one time of the year constantly; they
take it to be blood, when it is nothing else but the colouring of the
water by the dust of red earth or <i>minium</i>, which the winds constantly
at that time of the year from mount Libanus do drive into the water.<a id="FNanchor_275_275" href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>
Neither are the papists out in this point. I will only instance in that
observation of Dr Jenison, to confirm the doctrine and practice of
invocation:<a id="FNanchor_276_276" href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> they take the advantage of sovereign baths and waters,
and where they espy any fountain good against the stone, or other
diseases, presently there is the statue or image of some saint or other
erected by it, by whose virtue the cure and miracle must seem to be
done; or some chapel is erected to this or that saint, to whom prayers
before and thanks after washing must be offered.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, where the two former fail, men that devote themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
to this kind of service <i>imitate their father the devil, and fall to plain
lying and devised fables</i>. Idolatry was mainly underpropped by
fabulous stories; and no wonder, when they esteemed it a pious fraud
to nourish piety towards the gods, in which case, as Polybius saith,
though their writers speak monsters, and write childish, absurd, and
impossible things, yet are they to be pardoned for their good intent.<a id="FNanchor_277_277" href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a>
Among the papists what less can be expected, when the same principle
is entertained among them? Canus, and Lodovicus Vives mentioned
by him,<a id="FNanchor_278_278" href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> as also some few others, do exceedingly blame that
blind piety of coining lies for religion, and feigning histories for the
credit of their opinions; but while they with great freedom and
ingenuity do tax the fables of their own party, they do plainly
acknowledge that they are too much guilty of feigning, insomuch
that not only the author of the Golden Legend is branded with the
characters of a brazen face and a leaden heart, but also Gregory’s
Dialogues and Bede’s History are blamed by him, as containing narrations
of miracles taken upon trust from the reports of the vulgar.<a id="FNanchor_279_279" href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a>
And indeed the wonders they talk of are so strange, so unlikely, so
ridiculous and absurd some of them, that except a man offer violence
to his reason, and wilfully shut his eyes against the clear evidences of
suspicion, he cannot think they are anything else than dreams and
fables, no better than Æsop’s. You may meet with several catalogues
of them in protestant writers:<a id="FNanchor_280_280" href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> as their St Swithins making whole a
basket of broken eggs by the sign of the cross; Patricius his making
the stolen sheep to bleat in the thief’s belly after he had eaten it; their St
Bridget’s bacon, which in great charity she gave to a hungry dog, was
found again in her kettle; Dionysius after he was beheaded carried
his head in his hand three French miles; St Dunstan took the devil
by the nose with his tongs till he made him roar; Dominicus made
him hold the candle till he burnt his fingers; St Lupus imprisoned
the devil in a pot all night; a chapel of the Virgin Mary was translated
from Palestine to Loretto; a consecrated host, being put into a
hive of bees to cure them of the murrain, was so devoutly entertained
that the bees built a chapel in the hive, with doors, windows, steeple,
and bells, erected an altar and laid the host upon it, sung their canonical
hours, and kept their watches by night, as monks used to do in
their cloisters, &amp;c. Who would ever imagine that men of any seriousness
could satisfy themselves with such childish fopperies? These are
the usual ways by which men of design have raised the noise of miracles.</p>

<p>The other part of Satan’s coming<a id="FNanchor_281_281" href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> relates to himself and his own
actions. When his agents can go no further in the trade of miracle-making,
he as a spirit doth often make use of his power, knowledge,
and agility, by which he can indeed do things incredible and to be
wondered at: <i>Portenta fallacium spirituum</i>. It is nothing for him,
by his knowledge of affairs at a distance, of the private endeavours
or expressed resolves of princes, to prognosticate future events. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
his power over the bodies of men, he can, with the help of inclinations
and advantages, do much to bring a man into a trance, or take
the opportunity of a fit of an apoplexy, and then, like a cunning juggler,
pretend, by I know not what nor whom, to raise a man from death.
He knows the secret powers and virtues of things, and by private
applications of them may easily supply spirits, remove obstructions,
and so cure lameness, blindness, and many other distempers, and then
give the honour of the cure to what person or occasion may best fit
his design; so that either by the officious lies of his vassals, or the
exerting of his own power on suitable objects at fit times, he hath
made a great noise of signs and wonders in the world. And this
stratagem of his hath ever been at hand to gain a repute to false
doctrine. And the rather doth he insist upon this,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, Because true miracles are a divine testimony to truth. As
Nicodemus argued, John iii. 2, ‘No man could do these miracles
that thou doest except God be with him.’ And there were solemn
occasions wherein they were necessary; as when God gave public discoveries
of his mind before the Scriptures were written; and also when
he altered the economy of the Old Testament and settled that of the
New. In these cases it was necessary that God should confirm his
word by miracles. But now, though these ends of miracles are ceased,
though God hath so settled and fixed the rule of our obedience and
worship that no other gospel or rule is to be expected, and consequently
no need of new miracles, where the certain account of the old
miracles are sufficient attestations of old and unalterable truths; nay,
though God have expressly told us, Deut. xiii. 1, that no miracle—though
it should come to pass, and could not be discovered to be a
lie—should prevail with us to forsake the established truths and ways
of Scripture, or to entertain anything contrary to it; yet doth Satan
exercise herein a proud imitation of the supreme majesty, and withal
doth so dazzle the minds of the weaker sort of men—who are more
apt to consider the wonder than to suspect the design—that, without
due heed given to the cautions which God hath laid before us in that
particular, they are ready to interpret them to be God’s witness to this
or that doctrine, to which they seem to be appendant.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, Because Satan hath a more than ordinary advantage to
feign miracles; he doth more industriously set himself to pretend
them and to urge them for the accomplishment of his ends. It is an
easy work to prevail with men that are wholly devoted to their own
interest, under the mask of religion to say and do anything that may
further their design; and the business of miracles is so imitable by
art, through the ignorance and heedlessness of men, that with a small
labour Satan can do it at pleasure. The secret powers of nature—such
as that of the loadstone—by a dexterous application brought into
act in a fitly-contrived subject, will seem miraculous to those that see
not the secret springs of those actions. There have been artificial
contrivances of motions which, had they been disguised under a religious
form, and directed to such an end, might have passed for greater
miracles than many which we have mentioned. Such was the dove
of Archyas, which did fly in the air as if it had been a living creature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span><a id="FNanchor_282_282" href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a>
Such was the fly of Regiomontanus, and the eagle presented to the
Emperor Maximilian, which, in the compass of their little bodies,
contained so many springs and wheels as were sufficient to give them
motion, and to direct their courses as if they had been animated.
Albertus Magnus his artificial man, and the silver galley and tritons
made by a goldsmith at Paris,<a id="FNanchor_283_283" href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> were rare pieces of art—their motions
so certain and steady, that they seemed to have life and understanding.
If art can do all this, how much more may we suppose can Satan
do! how easily can he make apparitions, present strange sights to
the eye and voices to the ear, and, by putting out his power, do a
thousand things astonishing and wonderful!</p>

<p>(8.) Eighthly, <i>Sometimes Satan pleads for error, from the ease,
peace, or other advantages which men pretend they have received since
they engaged in such a way or received such a persuasion</i>. This is an
argument from the effect, and frequently used to confirm the minds
of men in their opinions. Hence they satisfy themselves with these
reasonings: ‘I was before always under fears and uncertainties; I
never was at peace or rest in my mind. I tried several courses, followed
several parties, but I never had satisfaction or comfort till now,
and by this I know that I am in a right way.’ Others argue after the
same manner from their abundance and outward prosperity: ‘I met
with nothing but crosses and losses before, but now God hath blessed
me with an increase of substance, prospered my trade and undertakings,’
&amp;c. These, though apparently weak and deceitful grounds,
are reputed strong and conclusive to those that are first resolved upon
an error. For men are so willing to justify themselves in what they
have undertaken, that they greedily catch at anything that hath the
least appearance of probability to answer their ends.</p>

<p>This plea of satisfaction is commonly from one of these two things:</p>

<p>1. First, <i>From inward peace and contentment of mind</i>. Satan
knows that peace is the thing to which a man sacrificeth all his
labours and travail. This he seeks, though often in a wrong way, and
by wrong means. He knows also that true peace is only the daughter
of truth, ‘the ways whereof are pleasantness, and the paths whereof
are peace;’ neither is he ignorant of the delights which a man hath,
by enjoying himself in the sweet repose of a contented mind, that he
may charm the hearts of the erroneous into a confidence and assurance
that they have taken a right course; he doth all he can to further a
false peace in them, and to this purpose he commonly useth this
method:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, He doth all he can to <i>unsettle them from the foundation
of truth upon which they were bottomed</i>. He labours to render things
suspicious, doubtful, or uncertain. This some have noted from 2
Thes. ii. 2, where Satan’s first attempts are to shake their minds, not
only by disquiet, of which we are next to speak, but by alteration of
their judgment; for mind is sometimes taken for sentence, opinion,
judgment, as 1 Cor. ii. 16, ‘We have the mind of Christ;’ and 1 Cor.
i. 10, ‘In the same mind, and in the same judgment.’<a id="FNanchor_284_284" href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, His second approach is to <i>raise a storm of restless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
disquiet upon that uncertainty</i>; and in order to his intended design,
he usually fills them with the utmost anxiety of mind, and makes
their thoughts, like a tempestuous sea, dash one against another.
This piece of his art is noted in the fore-cited place, that ‘ye be not
shaken in mind, or troubled:’ the word signifies a great perplexity,
θροεῖσθαι. And this is a usual method which the false teachers among
the Galatians practised; they first troubled them, and then endeavoured
by the advantage of that trouble to pervert the gospel of Christ,
Gal. i. 7, and v. 12. To effect both these, he doth amuse them with all
the objections that can be raised. If he can say anything of the antiquity
of the error, the number, wisdom, learning, or authority of
those that embrace it, they are sure to hear of these things to the
full. The danger of continuing as they were, and the happiness of
the new doctrine, are represented with all aggravating circumstances;
and these so often, that their thoughts have no rest: and if this restlessness
does wound or weaken them, he pursues with a high hand.
These ways of disturbing the unsettled mind are hinted to us in the
aforesaid place—spirit, word, letter, anything that carries a seeming
authority to unsettle, or power to amaze and distress. And we may
here further note, that where the minds of men are discomposed with
other fears or disquiets, Satan is ready to improve them to this use,
so that commonly when the word of God begins to work at first upon
the consciences of men, to awaken them to the consideration of their
sin and danger, the adversary is then very busy with them to inveigle
them into some error or other.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Having thoroughly prepared the mind with restless
fears, he then advanceth forward with the <i>proffers of peace and comfort
in the way of error which he proposeth</i>; and in this case error
will boast much, ‘Come to me, and ye shall find rest for your souls.’
How grateful and welcome the confident proffers of ease and satisfaction
are to a tossed and disquieted mind, any man will easily
imagine. It is usually thus: men that are tired out will easily embrace
anything for ease. A man in this case may be wrought upon
like wax, to receive any impression; he will fasten on anything, true
or false, that doth but promise comfort.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, The completement of his method is <i>to please the man
in the fruition of the peace promised</i>; and this he labours to do, not
only to fix the man in his delusion, but to make that man brag of ease,
to be a snare to others. And it is easy for the devil to do this: for,
<i>first</i>, The novelty of a new opinion doth naturally please, especially
if it give any seeming commendation for discovery or singularity. We
see men are fond of their own inventions, and delighted to be lifted up
above others. <i>Secondly</i>, Satan can easily allay the storm which he
himself raised: he gives over to molest with anxious thoughts—on the
contrary, he suggests thoughts of satisfaction. <i>Thirdly</i>, And whatever
he can do in a natural way to raise up our passions of joy and
delight, he will be sure to do it now, to ravishment and excess if he
can; and then he not only makes these men sure—for what argument
can stand before such a confidence?—but hath an active instrument
for the allurement of such as cannot discover these methods.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, <i>Outward prosperity</i> is the other common plea for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
error. Though successes, plenty, and abundance of worldly comforts
argue of themselves neither love nor hatred, truth nor falsehood—because
the wise providence of God, for holy ends and reasons often
undiscerned by us, permits often the tabernacles of robbers to prosper,
and permits those that ‘deal treacherously’ with the truths of God
‘to be planted, to take root, to grow, yea, to bring forth fruit’—nevertheless
if in a way of error they meet with outward blessings, they are
apt to ascribe all to their errors, and to say as Israel, Hosea ii. 5, ‘I
will go after my lovers that gave me my bread and my water, my wool
and my flax, mine oil and my drink,’ without any serious consideration
of God’s common bounty, which upon far other accounts,
‘gives them corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplies their silver and
gold,’ which they prepared for Baal, ver. 8. I shall not need to add anything
further for the proof and explanation of this than what we have
in Jer. xliv. 17, 18, where the Jews expressly advance their idolatrous
worship as the right way, and confirm themselves even to obstinacy in
the pursuit of it, upon this reason: ‘We will certainly do whatsoever
thing goeth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of
heaven ... for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and
saw no evil: but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of
heaven, and to pour out our drink-offerings unto her, we have
wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the
famine.’</p>

<p>(9.) Ninthly, Instead of better arguments, Satan usually makes <i>lies
his refuge</i>: and these respect either the truth which he would cry
down, or the errors which he would set up.</p>

<p>Those lies that are managed against truth are of two sorts: mistakes
and misrepresentations of its doctrines, or calumnies against the persons
and actions of those that take part with it.</p>

<p>Those lies that are proper to bespatter a truth withal are such as
tend to render it unlovely, inconvenient, or dangerous. Satan hath
never been a-wanting to raise up mists and fogs to eclipse the shining
beauty of truth. Sometime he persuades men that it is a novelty,
and contrary to the tradition of the fathers; and then, if an error had
been once upon the stage before, and had again been hissed out of the
world, when it peeps out again into the world, its former impudency
is made an argument for its antiquity, and truth is decried as novel.
Or if it be but an error of yesterday, and hath only obtained an age
or two, then the ghosts of our forefathers are conjured up as witnesses,
and the plea runs current, What has become of your fathers? or, are
you wiser than your fathers? are they all damned? These were
insisted on by the heathens: the gods of the country and the worship
of their fathers, they thought, should not be forsaken for Christianity,
which they judged was but a novelty in comparison of paganism.
Of the same extract is that old song of the papists, ‘Where was your
religion before Luther?’ and to this purpose they talk of the succession
of their bishops and popes. And other errors grow a little pert
and confident, if they can but find a pattern or sample for themselves
among the old heresies. Sometime he endeavours to bring truth into
suspicion, by rendering it a dangerous encroachment upon the rights
and privileges of men, as if it would turn all upside down, and intro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>duce
factions and confusions. This clamour was raised against the
gospel, that it would subvert the doctrine of Moses and the law.
Sometimes he clothes the opinions of truth with an ugly dress, and
misrepresents it to the world as guilty of strange inferences and
absurdities, which only arise from a wrong stating of the questions;
and where it doth really differ from error, he endeavours to widen the
differences to an inconvenient distance, so that if it go a mile from
error, Satan will have it to go two: if truth teach justification by faith,
error represents it as denying all care of holiness and good works;
if truth say bare moral virtues are not sufficient without grace, error
presently accuseth it as denying any necessary use of morality, or
affirming that moral virtues are obstructions and hindrances to salvation.
It were easy to note abundance of such instances.</p>

<p>As for calumnies against the persons and actions of those that are
assertors of truth, it is well known for an old threadbare design, by
which Satan hath gained not a little. Machiavel borrowed the policy
from him, and formed it into a maxim; for he found by experience
that where strong slanders had set in their teeth, though never so
unjustly, the wounds were never thoroughly healed; for some that
heard the report of the slander never heard the vindication, and those
that did were not always so unprejudiced as to free themselves from all
suspicion, but still something remained usually upon their spirits for
ever after; and that, like a secret venom, poisons all that could be said
or done by the persons that wrongfully fell under their prejudice, and
did not a little derogate from the authority and power of the truths
which they delivered.</p>

<p>The friends of truth have always to their cost found it so. Christ
himself escaped not the lies and censures of men when he did the
greatest miracles; they raised this calumny against him, that ‘he
cast out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils,’ John viii. 48.
When he shewed the most compassionate condescensions, they called
him ‘a man gluttonous, a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and
sinners;’ and at last, upon a misinterpretation of his speeches, ‘I will
destroy this temple, and in three days I will build it up,’ Mat. xxvi. 61,
they arraigned and condemned him for blasphemy; and his servants
have, according to what he foretold, drunk of the same cup: the
more eminent in service the greater draught. Paul, a chosen vessel, met
with much of this unjust dealing: he was accused, Acts xxi. 28, as
speaking against the people, the law, and the temple, and, chap.
xxiv. 5, called ‘a pestilent fellow, a mover of sedition, a profaner of
the temple.’ Neither can we wonder at this, that the greatest innocency
or highest degree of holiness is no armour or proof against the
sharp arrows of a lying tongue; when we read this as one of Satan’s
great characters, that he is ‘the accuser of the brethren,’ and that his
agents are so perfectly instructed in this art that they are also branded
with the same mark of ‘false accusers,’ Jude 10. It is well known how
the primitive Christians were used: they were accounted ‘the filth and
offscouring of all things;’ there could be nothing that could render
them odious or ridiculous but they were aspersed with it; as that they
‘sacrificed infants, worshipped the sun, and used promiscuous uncleanness;’
nay, whatever plague or disaster befell their neighbours, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
were sure to carry the blame. And we might trace this stratagem
down to our own days. Luther in his time was the common butt for
all the poisoned arrows of the papists’ calumny; which so exceeded all
bounds of sobriety and prudence that they devised a romance of his
death, how he was choked of the devil; that before he died he desired
his corpse might be carried into the church and adored with divine
worship; and that after his death the excessive stench of his carcase
forced all his friends to forsake him. All this and more to this purpose
they published while he was alive; whose slanders, worthy only
of laughter, he refuted by his own pen. The like fury they expressed
against Calvin by their Bolsecus, whom they set on work to fill a
book with impudent lies against him. Neither did Beza, Junius, or
any other of note escape without some slander or other. How unjustly
the Arians of old accused Athanasius of uncleanness, and of bereaving
Arsenius of his arm, is sufficiently known in history.<a id="FNanchor_285_285" href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>But the devil’s malice doth not always run in the dirty channel of
odious calumnies. He hath sometimes a more cleanly conveyance for
his lies against holy men. In prosecution of the same design, it is a
fair colour for error if he can abuse the name and credit of renowned
champions of truth, by fathering an error upon them which they never
owned. By this means he doth not only grace a false doctrine with
the authority of an eminent person, whose estimation might be a snare
to some well-meaning persons, but weakens the truth, by bringing a
faithful assertor of it into suspicion of holding, at least in some points,
dangerous opinions; by which many are affrighted from entertaining
anything that they write or preach. For though they may be confessedly
sound in the most weighty doctrines, yet if it be once buzzed
abroad that they are in anything unsound, this dead fly spoils all the
precious ointment. And the matter were yet the less if there were any
just cause for such a prejudice; but such is Satan’s art, that if a man
explains the same truth, but in different words and forms of speech
than those that others have been used unto; or if he casts it into a
more convenient mould, that, by laying aside doubtful or flexible
expressions, it may be more safely guarded from the exceptions of the
adversaries; especially if he carefully choose his path betwixt the
extremes on either hand,—this is enough for Satan to catch at, and
presently he bestows upon him the names of the very errors which he
most strenuously opposeth; nay, sometimes if he mention anything
above the reach or acquaintance of those that hear him, it is well if he
escapes the charge of heresy, and that he meets not with the lot of
Virgilius, bishop of Salzburg, who was judged no less than heretical
for venting his opinion concerning the antipodes.<a id="FNanchor_286_286" href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> I know men do
such things in their zeal; but while they do so they are concerned to
consider how Satan doth abuse their good meaning to the disservice of
truth.</p>

<p>As Satan’s design in bespattering the actions and doctrines of good
men is to bring the truth they profess into a suspicion of falsehood,
and to advance the contrary errors to the place and credit of truth, so
doth he use a skill proportionable to his design. And though he be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
so impudent that he will not blush at the contrivance of the most
gross and malicious lie, yet withal he is so cunning that he studiously
endeavours some probable rise for his slanders, and commonly he takes
this course:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, He doth all he can <i>to corrupt the professors of truth</i>. If
riches or honours will tempt them to be proud, high-minded, contentious,
or extravagant, he plies them with these weapons; if the pleasures
of the flesh and world be more likely to besot them, or to make
them sensual, earthly, or loose, he incessantly lays those baits before
them; if fears and persecutions can affright them out of duty, if
injuries and provocations may prejudice them into a froward or wayward
temper, he will certainly urge them by such occasions; and when
he hath prevailed in any measure, he is sure to aggravate every circumstance
to its utmost height, and upon that advantage to make additions
of a great many things beyond what they can be justly accused
of. This old device Paul, in Rom. ii. 24, takes notice of concerning
the Jews, whose breach of the law so dishonoured God that ‘the
name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles through them.’
The Jews lived wickedly, and their wicked lives was a current argument
among the Gentiles to confirm them in paganism; for they
judged the law of God could not approve itself to be better than their
own, when the professors of it were so naught. To prevent this
mischief, we are seriously warned to be carefully strict in all our
stations, ‘that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed,’
1 Tim. vi. 1; Titus ii. 5.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Whatever miscarriages any professor of truth is
guilty of, Satan takes care that it be presently charged upon all the
profession</i>. If any one offend, it is matter of public blame; much
more if any company or party shall run into extravagances, or do
actions strange and unjustifiable; those that agree with them in the
general name of their profession, though they differ as far from their
wild opinions and practices as their enemies do, shall still be upbraided
with their follies. We see this practised daily by differing parties;
according to what was foretold in 2 Pet. ii. 2, ‘false prophets’ seduce
a great number of Christians to follow their pernicious ways, and by
reason of their wild, ungodly behaviour, ‘the whole way of truth was
evil spoken of.’</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>The least slip or infirmity of the children of truth the
devil is ready to bring upon the stage</i>; and they that will not charge
themselves as offenders for very great evils, will yet object, to the disparagement
of truth, the smallest mistakes of others: a mote in the
eye of the lovers of truth shall be espied when a beam in the eye of
falsehood shall pass for nothing.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>Slanderous aspersions are sometimes raised from a
simple mistake of actions, and their grounds or manner of performance,
and sometimes from a malicious misrepresentation</i>. The devil
seldom acts from a simple mistake; but he will either suborn the
passionate opposers to a wilful perverting of the true management of
things, or will by a false account of things take the advantage of their
prejudice, to make men believe that such things have been said or
done, which indeed never were. The Christians in the primitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
times were reported to be bloody men, and that they did kill men in
sacrifice, and did eat their flesh and drink their blood; and this was
only occasioned by their doctrine and use of the sacrament of the body
and blood of Christ. They were accused for promiscuous uncleanness
with one another, and this only because they taught that there was no
distinction of male and female in respect of justification, and that they
were all brethren and sisters in Christ. This account Tertullian gives
of the calumnies of those times, and others have noted the like occasions
of other abuses of them.<a id="FNanchor_287_287" href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> They were reported to worship the
sun, because they in times of persecution were forced to meet early in
the fields, and were often seen undispersed at sunrising. They were
reported to worship Bacchus and Ceres, because of the elements of
bread and wine in the Lord’s supper. If they met in private places,
and in the night, it was enough to occasion surmises of conspiracy
and rebellion: so ready is Satan to take occasion where none is
given.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, But if none of these are at hand, then <i>a downright lie
must do the turn, according to that of Jer.</i> xviii. 18, ‘Come and let us
devise devices against Jeremiah;’ and when once the lie is coined,
Satan hath officious instruments to spread it: Jer. xx. 10, ‘Report,
say they, and we will report it.’</p>

<p>These were the lies raised against truth; but besides this endeavour,
he useth the same art of lying to enhance the credit of error. Lying
inspirations, lying signs and wonders we have spoken of; I shall only
mention another sort of lying, which is that of forgery, an art which
error hath commonly made use of. Sometimes books and writings
erroneous have been made to carry the names of men that never knew
or saw them. The apostles themselves escaped not these abuses: you
read of the counterfeit Gospels of Thomas and Bartholomew, the Acts
of Peter and Andrew, the Apostolical Constitutions, and a great many
more. Later writers have by the like hard usage been forced to
father the brats of other men’s brains. I might be large in these,
but they that please may see more of this in authors that have of purpose
discovered the frauds of spurious, supposititious books.<a id="FNanchor_288_288" href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> The
design is obvious: error would by this means adorn itself with the
excellent names of men of renown, that so it might pass for good
doctrine with the unwary.</p>

with the ornaments of truth.</i></p>


<p>The usual arguments by which Satan doth directly blind the understanding
to a persuasion to accept darkness for light, we have now
considered. It remains that some account be given of the second way
of prevailing upon the understanding, and that is <i>by swaying it through
the power and prevalency of the affections</i>. In order to this he hath
many devices, the principal whereof are these:—</p>

<p>1. First, <i>By silent and insensible procedure he labours to introduce
errors</i>; and lest men should startle at a sudden and full presentment
of the whole, he thinks it policy to insinuate into the affections, by
offering it in parcels. Thus he prevents wonderment and surprisal,
lest men should boggle and turn away, and doth by degrees familiarise
them to that which at first would have been rejected with abhorrency.
We read in the parable of the tares that the envious man which
sowed them, who was Satan, took his opportunity ‘while men slept,’
and then went away in the dark; insomuch that the discovery was
not made at the sowing, but at their coming up. In pursuance of
this policy, we find the principal instruments of Satan have followed
the footsteps of their master; they ‘creep in unawares,’ Jude 4; they
‘privily bring in damnable heresies,’ 2 Pet. ii. 1; and, as if they were
guilty of some modest shamefacedness, they ‘<i>creep</i> into houses,’ 2 Tim.
iii. 6. The steps by which the devil creeps into the bosoms of men
to plant error in the heart are these:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, He endeavours to gain the heart by <i>the ingenuous, sweet,
and delightful society of those that are corrupted already</i>. Error hath
a peculiar art to woo the good-will before it disclose itself. It first
steals the ear and affections to the person, and thence insensibly
derives it to the opinion. Truth is masculine, and persuades by teaching,
but error doth often teach by persuading. It is very difficult to
affect the person, and not to bestow upon the error better thoughts
than it deserves. Those therefore that are cunning in the art of
seduction, make extraordinary pretences of affectionate kindness, and,
as the apostle noted concerning the seducers of his time, Gal. iv. 17,
‘they zealously affect’ those whom they would delude, ‘but not well.’
Their art doth also teach them not to be over-hasty in propounding
their opinions, nor so much as to touch upon them, till they perceive
they have gained a firm persuasion of their amity, and of the reality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
of those kindnesses which they have made show of; but when they
have once gained this point of advantage, they take opportunity more
freely to propound and press their doctrines. Thus are men at last
beguiled ‘with enticing words.’</p>

<p>It is also part of the same design that Satan sometimes makes use
of women seducers: For, (1.) They are more apt to be deluded themselves:
‘silly women’ are soon ‘led captive.’ (2.) Being deceived,
they are most earnestly forward in the heat of zeal to propagate their
opinions. (3.) And by the advantage of their nature they are most
engaging; their affectionate persuasions usually have a peculiar prevalency.
The daughters of Moab, through Balaam’s counsel, were made
choice of as the fittest instruments to seduce Israel to idolatry. Solomon,
though a wise man, was prevailed with by the importunity of his
wives, against his former practice and knowledge, to favour false worship.
The woman Jezebel, Rev. ii. 20, was Satan’s under-agent ‘to
teach and seduce God’s servants to commit fornication, and to eat
things sacrificed to idols.’ (4.) Besides, they have a greater influence
upon their children to leaven them with their own opinions.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Satan also observes <i>a gradual motion in fixing any
particular error</i>. If he attempt it immediately, without an external
agent, he first puts men upon the reading or consideration of some
dark passages that seem to look favourably upon his design; then he
starts the notion or objection; then begets a scruple or questioning.
Having once proceeded thus far, he follows his design with probable
reasons, till he have formed it into an opinion. When it is come
to this, a little more begets a persuasion, that persuasion he ripens
into a resoluteness and obstinacy, and then at last fires it with zeal
for the deluding of others. Having thus laid the foundation by one
error, he next endeavours to multiply it, and then brings in the inferences
that unavoidably follow; for as one wedge makes way for
another, so from one falsehood another will easily force itself, and
from two or three who knows how many? And though the consequences
are usually more absurd than the principles, yet are
they with a small labour brought into favour where the principles
are first confidently believed; so that those errors, which because of
their ugly look Satan durst not at first propound, lest he should scare
men off from their reception, he can now with an undaunted boldness
recommend. It cannot be imagined that ever men would at first have
entertained opinions of contempt of ordinances and libertinism, and
therefore we may observe they usually come in the rear of other
opinions, which by a long tract of art prepare their way.</p>

<p>Yet may we note, that though Satan usually is forced to wait the
leisure of some men’s timorousness and bashfulness, and therefore
cannot ripen error to a hasty birth as he desires, hence is it that one
man often doth no more for his time, but only brew it, or, it may be,
makes only the rude draught of it, and another vents and adorns it;
for so it was betwixt Lælius and Faustus Socinus, betwixt David
George and his successors. And though he be so confined to the first
principles of error which he hath instilled that he cannot at present
enlarge them beyond their own just consequences; yet there are some
choice principles of his which, if he can but fasten upon the mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
they presently open the gap to all kind of errors imaginable. They
are like the firing a train of gunpowder, which in a moment blows up
the whole fabric of truth. Such are the delusions of enthusiasm,
inspirations, and prophetic raptures. Let these be once fixed, and
then there is nothing so inhuman, irreligious, mad, or ridiculous, but
Satan can with ease persuade men to it, and also under the highest
pretences of religion and certainty. The experience of all ages hath
made any further proof of this altogether needless.</p>

<p>This is his way when he acts alone. But if he use instruments,
though he is also gradual in his procedure, yet it is in a different method;
for there he sometimes proceeds from the abuse of something innocent
and lawful, by the help of a long tract of time, to introduce the grossest
falsehood. Thus may we conceive he brought idolatry to its height:
first men admired the wisdom or famous acts of their progenitors or
benefactors; next they erected pillars or images of such persons to
perpetuate the names, honour, and memory of them and their actions.
Another age, being at a greater distance from the things done, and
consequently greater strangers to the true ends and reasons of such
practices, which being, as it usually falls out in such cases, abused by
false reports or misrepresentations of things—for time covers things of
this nature with so thick a mist that it is difficult to discover the true
metal of an original constitution—they in a devout ignorance gave
the images a greater respect than was at first intended. Then did
they slide into a conceit they were not of the ordinary rank of mortals,
or at least they were exalted to a condition which ordinary mortals
were not capable of. Thus they supposed them deities, and gave
them worship of prayers and sacrifices. Hence they went further,
and multiplied gods, and that of several sorts, according to the natures
of things that were good or hurtful to them; and then at last consulting
how mean their offerings were, and how unlikely to please their
godships, they concluded human sacrifices most suitable, especially to
expiate greater provocations, and in times of great calamity.</p>

<p>The burdensome heap of ceremonious superstitions in popery was
the work of several ages; they were not brought in all at once. One
in a devotional heat fancied such a ceremony as a fit testimony of zeal,
or a proper incitement of his affections; another deviseth a second,
and so all along. As the minds of men were best pleased with their
own inventions, and had so much credit or authority to recommend
them to others, they increased the sum by new additions, till at last
they are become a burden not to be borne; and still as they receded
from the primitive purity, and became more careless and corrupt in
their lives—for from good bishops they declined to but tolerable archbishops,
till at last they are become incurable Babylonians—so they
departed gradually from the simplicity of the gospel, and abounded in
contrivances of ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_289_289" href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>In corrupting established truths</i>. Satan’s proceedings
are not by sudden and observable leaps, but by lingering and slow
motions—as flowers and plants grow insensibly, and as men gradually
wax old and feeble. Violent and hasty alterations he knows would
beget observation, dislike, and opposition; neither will he make such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
attempts but where he is sure of a strong prevalent party, which by
force and power is able to carry all before it. In this case he is willing
to enforce error by fire and sword. Thus he propagated Mohammedanism
at first, and still continueth to do so by the conquering arms
of the Turks; but where he hath not this advantage, he betakes himself
to another course, and studieth to do his work so that he may
not be observed. The possibility of such a change, with the manner
of effecting it, we may observe in many churches that have declined
from the doctrine which they at first received, but most of all in the
church at Rome, which at first was a pure church, as the apostle
testifieth, but now so changed from the truths upon which they were
bottomed in their first constitution, as if she had not been the same
church. They boast indeed that as they were at first, so they are
now; but nothing is more evident than the contrary; and the possibility
of their insensible corruption is as demonstrable as the alteration
of doctrine in any other church. The manifold ways that Satan takes
in this matter, in the abuse of Scripture, by raising perverse interpretations
and unnatural inferences, and the advantages of a long succession
in authority; of the negligence and ignorance of the common
people; of the crafty subtlety of the teachers, especially when religion
began to be abused to secular interest, is described by Acontius and
others.<a id="FNanchor_290_290" href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> If we should single out any of their noted errors, and follow
up the history of it to its first original, we shall find that whatever
strong current it hath now gotten, it was very small and inconsiderable
in the fountain. The invocation of saints, though it be now an
established article among them, yet its first rise was from the unwary
<i>prosopopœias</i> of the ancients, and the liberty of their oratorical declamatory
style. These gave occasion to some private opinions, these
opinions to some private devotional liberty in practice, and from private
opinions and practices, at last it obtained so strong a party that it
procured a public injunction. The like method was used for the
doctrine of transubstantiation, whose beginning was from the abuse of
such sentences as this in ancient writers, that ‘after consecration it was
no more bread and wine, but the body and blood of Christ;’ by which
expression the authors intended no more than this, that the bread
and wine in the sacrament were relatively altered, and were more
than ordinary bread and wine, because they were representatives of
the body and blood of Christ: however, this gave them courage to
interpret literally and strictly these words of Christ, ‘This is my
body;’ and thus by degrees from the opinion of a few it became the
judgment of many, and from the toleration of a private opinion of
some doctors, and unimposed, it obtained at last a canon to make it
authentic public doctrine.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, This insensible proceeding is in nothing more evident
than <i>in the power of custom and education</i>. Custom doth by
degrees take off the startling of conscience; and those opinions or
practices which at first look affright it, are by a little familiarity made
more smooth and tolerable. The dissents of men by frequent seeing
and hearing become tame and gentle; but the force of education is
incomparably great, for this makes an error to become as it were na<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>tural;
they suck it in with their milk, and draw it in with their air.
This general advantage the devil hath over all the children of erroneous
parents, especially where countries or nations are of the same persuasion;
insomuch that Turks have as great belief of their Alcoran as we
of the Bible, and think as reverently of Mohammed as Christians do of
Christ. The children of idolatrous pagans have as great a confidence
of the truth of their way of heathenish worship, as we have of God’s
ordinances and institutions.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, We may see something of this stratagem of silent entanglement
<i>in Satan’s surprisals</i>; for sometimes he inveigles men at
unawares, and engageth them in error while they know not what they
are doing. Weak heads cannot see the far end of a smooth-faced
doctrine, and they usually embrace it by wholesale, for some particular
that strikes upon their fancy, or gratifies their humour. If they read
a book that hath some good things in it, or is affectionate, for the sake
of these they swallow all the rest, though never so dangerous doctrine,
without further examination. The like advantage he hath from actions
that are bad or tolerable, according to the various respects which they
have to the ends or consequences that lie before them; for he frequently
doth interest men in an erroneous consequence, by concerning them
in actions that lead that way; and having thus beguiled them into an
evil mistake, instead of drawing their foot out of the snare, he pusheth
them forward to maintain their ground, and to justify their proceedings.
This was the case of some of the Corinthians; when the heathens
had offered a sacrifice to an idol, part of the sacrifice was reserved,
and either sold at the shambles, or used in a feast, to which the
heathens sometimes invited their Christian acquaintance or relations.
Those that went, knowing that ‘an idol was nothing,’ ate what was
set before them without any regard to the idol, and ‘making no question
for conscience sake;’ by their example others that ‘had not that
knowledge,’ 1 Cor. viii. 7, were emboldened, not only to eat against
their scruples and doubts of conscience,—which is all that many interpreters
think to be intended in that place,—but also—as the words make
probable—with some positive regard to the idol; so that by the examples
of those that sat in the idol’s temple, eating what was set before them
as common meat, others misinterpreting their actions, proceeded to eat
with a conscience of the idol, as if the idol had been something indeed,
and deserving a conscientious regard. Not unlike to this was that art
of Julian, mentioned by Sozomen, whereby he endeavoured to twist
something of paganism with actions and things that were lawful or
necessary.<a id="FNanchor_291_291" href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> He caused the images of Mars and Mercury to be placed
by his own, so that the respects that were payed to the emperor’s
picture, seemed to carry a concomitancy of reverence to those idols.
He also, in prosecution of the same policy, caused their meats and
drinks to be sprinkled or mixed with the lustral water, that so every
one that used them might be inured to give some regard to his idols;
and that some, at least, might be engaged to a justification of that and
such other practices.</p>

<p>All these are but instances of Satan’s silent insinuation, by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
he secretly steals the affections, and through these taints the judgment.
Next follows,</p>

<p>A second plot upon the affections, which is an endeavour to entangle
them by <i>the external garb of error</i>. In this he works by two contrary
extremes, that he may the better prevail with men’s different dispositions.</p>

<p>[1.] First, He sometimes <i>clothes a false doctrine with the most
pompous, gorgeous, delightful attire</i>, that, like Solomon’s harlot, it
may entice those that are pleased with the highest gratifications of
the senses, ‘I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with
fine linen of Egypt,’ &amp;c. Most men that are given up to an animal
life cannot be pleased with any religion but such as may most please
the senses. They so disrelish the simplicity of the gospel—which is,
notwithstanding, its particular mark and honour, 2 Cor. xi. 3—that
they cannot persuade themselves they do anything in religious worship
except they abound in costly ceremonious observances. Thus
do some interpret that fear of the heathens, which first put them upon
images and outward representations of their gods. They were afraid
they should not have any religion to their own satisfaction, except
they proceeded in such a course as might make their senses sure that
they were doing something, <i>primus in orbe deos timor fecit</i>. The
devil, knowing well the force of external beauties in religion, prepared
the way to idolatry by it. They had their costly temples, some of
them admirable for antiquity and magnificence, enriched with gifts
and offerings, excellent for matter and workmanship, adorned with
images, lamps, beds, and tables of gold, beautified by art, and natural
pleasantness of situation; they had also their groves in the most pleasant
and delightful places, as that of the Daphne, besides<a id="FNanchor_292_292" href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> Antiochia,
which was environed with tall cypress trees ten miles about, and
within adorned with the sumptuous temples of Apollo and Diana’s
sanctuary. In these places they had their music and solemn
festivals, which were sometimes extraordinary for cost and continuance.
Antiochus at Daphne continued an incredible solemnity, with a vast
train and costly preparation, for thirty days’ together; and that nothing
might be wanting, they had their annual feasts, sacrifices, rites, the
adornments of their priests, their white garments, their coats of divers
colours, their mitres, &amp;c.; in a word, nothing was lacking that might
please the eye or ear. And doubtless the devil found this course very
successful to win the affections of men to Gentilism. And if it were
not for this consideration, it might be admired that the Jews, who
were instructed in the true worship of God, should, notwithstanding,
be so prone to idolatry, and so hardly drawn from it; but surely their
strong inclinations that way proceeded from a natural delight that
men have in a sensual religion, which, by a powerful witchcraft, doth
enchant them to an excess of love. The same method the devil takes
in popery. The chief enticement lies in its glorious external appearance.
All their religious places are dressed up in the highest bravery,
they are beautified with images and pictures, with lights and costly
adornments; they abound in rites, ceremonies, gestures, and obser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>vances,
and all this is but to dazzle the eyes, and to win a reverence in
men to their worship; and accordingly they practise in these exterior
things on purpose to ravish men’s affections; their children are
brought up to a confirmed delight and resolution for popery, by pleasing
them with shows, pictures, representations, processions, and grateful
observances. If a stranger of another religion come among them,
then, as their first essay, they shew them all their play-things, that their
affections may be tickled with the outward pomp and ornament of
their way, for they know by experience that a glittering outside and
a great deal ado of bodily labour is the all of most men’s religion. If
it have but body enough, they never inquire whether it have spirit or
life within. A dead carcase in robes, that may put them to the
exercise of their postures and ceremonious compliments, doth make up
a more grateful religion for a carnal man than a living, spiritual service,
that necessarily will put them upon inward care and watchfulness
in the constant exercise of holy spiritual graces, without affording any
considerable gratification to the senses. Hence is it truly more
difficult, and yet inwardly more beautiful and glorious, to pray in
faith and humility, even in short breathings after God, than to say a
thousand Ave Marias, or to perform a task of ordinary penance. But
as those that have no children of their own delight themselves in
playing with a monkey or baboon, so those that know not how to worship
God in spirit and truth seek to satisfy themselves in the performance
of external gesture and ceremony.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, On the other hand he sometimes is willing that an
error should affect <i>an excess of plainness and simplicity</i>. In this he
takes advantage of those expressions in Scripture, wherein the gospel
is commended for its simplicity; and the inventions of men, under the
pretences of wisdom, humility, and neglecting of the body, are condemned.
Upon this ground he runs men upon such an excess of
dotage, that they never think the things of God are rightly managed
but when they are brought down to a contemptible silliness. By this
means he arms conceited ignorant men with exceptions against learning,
and the necessary decencies of language in preaching; and with
them they are the only preachers, and most likely to be inspired, that
use least study and preparation for their work. It is indeed very true
that the affected fooleries of a bombast style or starched discourse, and
needless citations of sentences for ostentation, without any true advantage
to the matter in hand, are things very pedantic, and exceedingly
unsuitable to the gravity of the work of the ministry, and renders
it very ungrateful to a pious mind; but this contrary folly makes the
solemn ordinances of God so nauseous and contemptible, that it often
makes way, by Satan’s cunning improvement of the temptation, to an
atheistical rejection of all worship. In the meantime it is wonderful
to observe how some persons please themselves with this conceit, that
their way of worship is plain, and that they speak what immediately
comes into their mind; and though it be nonsense or contradictions,
which sufficiently evidenceth that it is nothing of kin to the Spirit’s
inspirations, which they utter, yet it is argument enough to them that
their opinions and ways are right, because they proceed in a designed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
neglect of all necessary order, and under pretence of the simplicity of
the gospel they reduce all they do to childish silliness. Neither is this
all the mischief which the devil raiseth out of this conceit, for the
contempt and disuse of the sacraments may in great part be ascribed
to it. Those erroneous ways of worship that are most noted for
decrying those institutions of Christ, have this for their plea, that the
worship which God is best pleased with is spiritual, and that all bodily
services and external observations are things that God stands not
upon, such as profit little, and were no further in use, but to recommend
an internal spiritual communion with God; so that the more
they reject these things, they persuade themselves they have a more
true understanding of the design of God in religion. Either of these
ways Satan makes use of for the befooling of men into a humour of
pleasing themselves with error. But,</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, He hath of old endeavoured <i>to cloud and enervate the
doctrine of the Bible by traditionary fables</i>. We meet with many
passages to this purpose. Sometimes he sets up unwritten traditions,
not only of equal authority to the written word, but as completions and
perfections of it. This he practised among the Jews with such success,
that the traditions of the elders were of greater force with them than the
commands of God, as Christ himself noted of them, Mat. xv. 13. Of
these unwritten traditions, which they called ‘the law by the word of
mouth,’ feigned by them to be given to Moses when he was in the
mount, and so delivered from hand to hand, the apostles gave many
warnings, and signified the hazards that truth stood in by them through
the cunning of Satan; as Col. ii. 8, ‘Beware lest any man spoil you
through the traditions of men;’ 1 Tim. i. 4, ‘Neither give heed to
fables, and endless genealogies;’ Titus i. 14, ‘Not giving heed to
Jewish fables, and commandments of men;’ 2 Tim. iv. 4, ‘And they
shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto
fables.’</p>

<p>The papists at this day give the same entertainment to this device
that the Jews did of old; they boast as high of their traditions, and
are every whit as fabulous and foolish in them as they were. Satan
in his attempts upon the Gentiles to confirm them in their false worship,
though he kept up the substance of this design, yet he was
necessitated to alter the scene a little, that he might more handsomely
accommodate it to their condition; and therefore he set up amongst
them fabulous imitations of the truths and ordinances of the Scripture,
insomuch that there is scarce any grand mystery or remarkable history or
ordinance mentioned in the Scripture but we may find something among
the heathens in tradition or practice that doth allude to it. What
traditionary imitations had they of the creation recorded in the book
of Genesis! That of Ovid concerning the chaos and first beginning
of things is known to every schoolboy. The Phœnicians in their theology
give an odd account of it from their Taautus, to this purpose:<a id="FNanchor_293_293" href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>
‘That the first beginnings of all things were a dark, disordered chaos,
and the spirit of the dark air; hence proceeded <i>moth</i>, that is, mire,
from thence issued the seeds and generation of all creatures in earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
and heaven,’ &amp;c. The wickedness of men before the flood—mentioned
Gen. vi. 1, 2—is fabulously related in an ancient book, falsely ascribed
to Enoch, wherein the watchmen or angels are reported to take them
wives of the daughters of men, and that from thence was the race of
giants.<a id="FNanchor_294_294" href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> For the description of paradise, the heathens had the poetical
fiction of the Elysian fields; as they had the story of Deucalion, instead
of Noah’s ark and the deluge. The story of Lot’s wife was abused by
the fiction of Orpheus his wife, suddenly snatched from him for looking
back. The history of Samson was turned into their story of
Hercules and his ten labours. From the sun standing still in Joshua
and Hezekiah’s time, came that fiction of Jupiter’s doubling the night,
that he might enjoy Alcmena. In some of these disguises of sacred
story, they go so near in name and circumstances, that it is past doubt
they imitated the true history, which they corrupted. For instance,
Herodotus relates that Sethon, king of Egypt and priest of Vulcan,
was helped by his god from heaven against Sennacherib, which plainly
relates to Hezekiah king of Judah, and the wonders that God did for
him.<a id="FNanchor_295_295" href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> So in imitation of Uriah’s letters to Joab for his own destruction,
we have in Homer and others the story of Prœtus sending letters to
Jobatas by Bellerophon, wherein his death was commanded; the near
affinity of the names Joab and Jobatas, shews with what heifer the
devil ploughed. The history of Abraham’s offering up Isaac is by
Porphyry applied to Saturn, who saith he was by the Phœnicians called
Israel; he had by Anobreth one only son called Jeud,—an evident
allusion, saith Godwyn, [Antiq., lib. iv. cap. 3,] to Gen. xxii. 2, where
Isaac is in the Hebrew called Jechid, that is, an only-begotten,—him
he offered up on an altar purposely prepared. Here not only the
matter, but the names, do clearly shew that Abraham’s story is
imitated in this. The like imitation I might shew to have been
among the heathen of doctrinal truths, as of the sacred mystery of the
Trinity. In Peru they worship the father, son, and brother; as also
their Tangatauga, which they say was one in three, and three in one.<a id="FNanchor_296_296" href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a>
But their imitation of ordinances is everywhere remarkable, so that I
need say nothing of their temples, priests, sacrifices, and other religious
rites; only the devil’s imitation of the sacraments of the New Testament
deserves particular observation. Instances of an apish imitation
of baptism are everywhere obvious, and that of the Lord’s supper or
Christian communion was frequently resembled in the chief Peruvian
feasts, where they carried small loaves of bread in great platters of gold,
of which all present received and ate little pieces, and this as a sign of
honour and profession of obedience to their gods and the ingua.<a id="FNanchor_297_297" href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> Not
unlike to this were those morsels of paste which the Mexicans used in
their religious feasts, which they laid at their idol’s feet, consecrating
them by singing and other ceremonies, and then they called them the
flesh and bones of their god Vitziliputzli, alluding directly to that of
our Saviour, ‘This is my body,’ &amp;c., insomuch that Acosta thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
the devil mocked their transubstantiation by it. This was distributed
among all, and was eaten with a great deal of reverence, fear, and
devotion.<a id="FNanchor_298_298" href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></p>

<p>We may see by those instances that in these fabulous imaginations
of truth the devil hath industriously traded, and that which he aimed
at in this design may easily be conjectured to be,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>The despiting and discrediting of truth.</i> He renders it by this
means suspicious of some forgery; as if the Scripture were no better
than an uncertain tradition, as if, at the best, it were doubtful whether
Scripture or these traditionary fables had better authority.</p>

<p>[2.] He further intends <i>the entanglement of the affections to error
by this device</i>; for he doth, as it were, take the spoils of the tabernacle
to adorn his Dagon withal; and without doubt the heathens were very
much hardened in Gentilism by these traditionary stories. Hence
one observes,<a id="FNanchor_299_299" href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> the devil imitated the history of the miracle done in
favour of Hezekiah, that the Scriptures might lose their credit and
authority, and that the glory of such a wonder might be transferred to
their idols; and the consequence of both these is,</p>

<p>[3.] <i>To deprive the truth of its convincing power upon the consciences
of men.</i> The principles of Scripture convince by the evidence
of their truth. If that truth be questioned by the substitution of another
competitor, it presently loseth its force, and the commands thereof
are disregarded upon a supposition of its uncertainty.</p>

<p>[4.] Another of his ways to betray the understanding by the affections,
is by <i>putting men upon an accommodation of truth to a compliance
with parties differing from it</i>. And this hath been so much the
more successful, because it hath begun, and been carried on, upon the
most specious pretences. The avoiding of offences, the smoothing of
the way of religion for the gaining of the contrary minded, the preservation
of peace and unity, are pleas very plausible; and really, upon
the account of these things, the Scripture, both by its precepts and
examples, hath recommended to us condescensions and brotherly forbearances.
The Jews, who were dissatisfied at the first publication of
the liberty from the yoke of Mosaical ceremonies purchased for us by
Christ, were indulged in the use of circumcision, and observance of the
difference of meats for a long time, till they might be the better satisfied
in the truth. These pretences the devil makes use of to undermine
truth. And pleasing his agents with the honour of a pious
design—and it may be at first really so intended by them—he prevails
with them, not only for a present condescension to men of contrary
practice, but to cast the principles of truth into such a fixed mould
that they may carry a more near resemblance to those opinions which
they do most directly oppose. The appearance of sanctity, peaceableness,
prudence, and successfulness in such an undertaking, doth exceedingly
animate the well-meaning designers, which Satan, in the
meantime, carries them beyond all bounds, and so dangerously fixeth
an unnatural representation of truth, that it loseth its own splendour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
and settles at last upon unsafe notions. Thus by the continuance of
such a compliance, error begins to recruit its forces, and is as likely
to draw over truth wholly to its side—by the argument of resemblance,
and the consequences following thereupon—as truth is wholly to extirpate
and conquer error. And if it do not that, succeeding ages,
that minded not the first design, finding things so continued to them,
in deep reverence to their predecessors, form their prudential condescensions
into perverse opinions.</p>

<p>If we follow the tract of time from the first preaching of the gospel,
we may find Satan’s footsteps all along. In the apostles’ times, when
the believing Jews were tolerated necessarily till time and experience
might fully convince them in their observation of the law of Moses,
which was certainly given of God, and so might very easily occasion
an opinion of the continuance of it, Acts xv. 1, 5, though the apostles
did not at all accommodate the standing precepts of the New Testament
to carry a perpetual resemblance of that opinion, neither did
they still countenance that practice, but did seasonably and fully declare
against it, exhorting Christians ‘to stand in the liberty wherewith
Christ hath made them free,’ Gal. v. 1, 2, yet Satan was busy to
take advantage of the present forbearances, which the Holy Ghost had
directed them unto; insomuch that instead of convincing all the dissenters
by that lenity, some dissenters waxed bold to persuade the
Christians ‘to another gospel.’ But after their days the devil pursued
this design with greater scope; for instance, in Constantine’s time,
when the Gentiles flocked into the church with dirty feet and in their
old rags, they were tolerated in some old customs of Gentilism, and
upon a design to win them, they made bold to bend the doctrine of
the gospel toward their former usages; they thought indeed it was
best to wink at things, and not to bear too hard upon them at first,
but that, tolerating a lesser evil, they might avoid a greater inconvenience;
and withal they deemed they had done great service to
the church and Christian religion, if they could any way divert the
heathen from worshipping their idols. And to effect this the easilier,
they seemed to cherish their customs and rites of worship, as consonant
in the general to the principles of Christianity, only they excepted
against the object of their worship as unlawful, so that upon the matter
they did no more than change the name. The manifold inconveniences
that followed this kind of dealing, they did not discover at first; but
besides the infecting the simplicity of Christian religion with the dirt
and dregs of paganism, which they might easily have seen, time hath
since discovered that here the devil secretly laid the chief foundations
of popery.</p>

<p>Whosoever shall impartially compare the rites, customs, usages, and
garbs of popery, with those of paganism, will to his admiration find
such an exact agreement and consonancy, that he must necessarily
conclude that either paganism imitated popery, or popery imitated
paganism; but the latter is true, and that these corruptions in religion
by popery came in by a designment of conforming Christianity to
heathenism, though it may be upon pious intentions at first, is no
difficult thing to evince; for besides that the rites of paganism were
more ancient, and so could not be borrowed from popery, which came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
long after, the Scripture did foretell a great defection from truth
which should be in the ‘last days,’ and this under a profession of religion;
and the things particularised are such as shew that the defection
should carry an imitation of paganism: for no less seems to be signified
by 1 Tim. iv. 1, ‘The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits,
and doctrines of devils;’ that is—as Mr Mede, whose interpretation I
follow,<a id="FNanchor_300_300" href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> doth prove—doctrines concerning devils or demons: as in Heb.
vi. 2, we have the phrase of ‘doctrines of baptisms,’ which must needs
signify doctrines concerning baptisms; the Gentile theology of demons
is the thing which Paul prophesies should be introduced into Christianity.
How clearly this relates to popery may be evident to any that
doth not wilfully blind himself by prejudice. Their doctrine of demons
was this: they supposed two sorts of gods, supreme and inferior; the
supreme they supposed did dwell in the heavenly lights, sun, moon,
and stars, without change of place; these they judged were so sublime
and pure, that they might not be profaned with the approach of earthly
things, and that immediate approaches to them were derogatory to
their sovereignty. The inferior order of gods they imagined were of a
middle sort, betwixt the supreme beings and men, as participating of
both. These they called mediators and agents, and supposed their
business was to carry up men’s prayers to God, and to bring down
blessings from God upon men. These were in Scripture called
Baalim, and by the Greeks demons; to this purpose Austin and others
speak.<a id="FNanchor_301_301" href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p>Now these demons they supposed were the souls of dead men, that
had been more than ordinarily famous in their generation. Thus
Ninus made an image to his father Belus after he was dead, and
caused him to be worshipped. Hermes confesseth that Æsculapius,
grandfather to Asclepius, and Mercury, his own grandfather, were
worshipped as gods of this order. Abundance of instances I might
produce to this purpose; but to go on, these demons, because to them
was committed the care of terrestrial affairs, as Celsus argues against
Origen, and because of the help and advantage that men might receive
from them, they supposed it gratitude and duty to worship them, and
this worship they performed at their images, sepulchres, and relics.
To this purpose Plutarch tells us of Theseus his bones, and Plato of
the θῆκαι or shrines of their demons.<a id="FNanchor_302_302" href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<p>How evident is it that the papists in their doctrine and practice
about the invocation of saints and angels, have writ after this copy,
and that they are the men that have introduced this doctrine of
demons, the thing itself declares without further evidence. Had the
heathens their dead heroes for agents betwixt the supreme gods and
men? so have the papists their dead saints to offer up their prayers.
Did the heathen expect more particular aids from some of these
demons in several cases than from others? so do the papists. Instead
of Diana for women in labour, and Æsculapius for the diseased, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
have their St Margaret and St Mary for travailing; Sebastian and
Roch against the pestilence; Apollonia against the toothache; St
Nicholas against tempests, &amp;c. Did the heathen pray to these demons
for their aid? so do the papists to their saints, as their breviaries,
rosaries, and Lady’s psalters testify. Had the heathen their feasts,
their <i>statas ferias</i> to their demons? so have the papists. Had they
their <i>Februalia et Proserpinilia</i> with torches and lights? so have the
papists their Candlemas with lights. Did the heathen erect images and
pillars, or keep the ashes and shrines of their demons? so do the
papists; the one had processions and adorations, so have the other;
and a great many more things there are wherein popery keeps a correspondence
with heathenism. To this purpose you may read enough
in Monsieur de Croy, ‘Of the Three Conformities.’</p>

<p>To make it yet more clear that the corruptions in religion by popery
came in by the design of suiting Christian religion to paganism, I shall
in a testimony or two shew you that they professedly avouched the
design. Gregory the Great writes chidingly to Serenus, bishop of
Marseilles, who it seems was no forward man in this matter to this
purpose,<a id="FNanchor_303_303" href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> ‘Thou shouldst have considered that thou didst converse
chiefly with the Gentiles, to whom pictures are instead of reading, to
the end that no offence be given them under colour of lawful zeal,
wherewith thou art not cunningly endued.’ And in another epistle to
Mellitus,<a id="FNanchor_304_304" href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> he adviseth, ‘That the honours and offerings which the
heathens gave to their demons should be transferred to the martyrs
and their relics,’ and gives this reason for it, ‘It is impossible,’ saith
he, ‘to cut off all at once from stubborn minds.’<a id="FNanchor_305_305" href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> Eusebius also endeavours
to persuade to Christianity by this argument, that the
Christians’ custom of honouring the memories of the martyrs, and
solemnly assembling at their sepulchres, did agree with the custom of
the Gentiles of doing the like honour to their demons, and having
mentioned what Hesiod speaks concerning Plato’s opinion, that their
champions became demons after death, helpers and protectors of men—for
which cause they were worshipped at their sepulchres as gods; he
adds to this purpose, that ‘if these honours had been given to the
favourites of God, and champions of true religion, it had been well
enough;’ and for this shews the example and custom of Christians
then to go to the tombs of martyrs, there to pray in honour of their
blessed spirits. And although at first they might be more modest
in honouring the martyrs than now they are, according to that of
Austin, ‘These observances at the tombs of martyrs,’ saith he, ‘are
only ornaments of their memories, not sacrifices to them as to gods.’<a id="FNanchor_306_306" href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a>
Yet this soon slid into greater abuse, insomuch that Lud. Vives,<a id="FNanchor_307_307" href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> in
his notes on that chapter, blames those of his own time for worshipping
saints as gods, and tells us he cannot see the difference betwixt the
opinion concerning saints, as generally practised, and that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
heathens concerning their gods. I might add the positive acknowledgment
of Beatus Rhenanus, Jacobus de Voragine, concerning the
burning of candles to the Virgin Mary, which custom they confess
was borrowed from the heathens, with a respect to the frowardness
of paganism, and a design not to exasperate them, that they might
gain them.</p>

<p>I might also shew that the mischief of this design, of accommodating
truth to a compliance with different parties, hath not only shewn
itself in introducing strange actions and ceremonies, but hath also
discovered itself in leavening men’s judgments in reference to opinion.
Calvin conjectures<a id="FNanchor_308_308" href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> that those confident assertions of the powers of
nature were first occasioned by an over-officious willingness to reconcile
the doctrine of the Scripture with the opinions of philosophy;
and that men being unwilling to run the hazard of the scorn which
they might meet with in contradicting the general received principles
of philosophers, were willing to form the doctrine of truth relating to
human ability accordingly. Abundance of instances of this kind may
be given. Whence came the doctrine of purgatory, but from hence?
It is but Plato’s philosophy Christianised by the Roman synagogue.<a id="FNanchor_309_309" href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a>
He divided all men into three ranks: the virtuous, who are placed
by him in the Elysian fields; the desperate ungodly, these he adjudgeth
to everlasting fire; and a third sort, betwixt the perfectly
virtuous and the desperately wicked, he sendeth to Acheron, to be
purged by punishment. All of this Eusebius makes mention of at
large.<a id="FNanchor_310_310" href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> That the papists derived their purgatory from hence is generally
affirmed by protestants—nay, not only in these cases, but in very
many more, corruptions have entered into Christianity by an over-eager
endeavour to make the doctrine of the Scriptures to run even
with the sayings and assertions of the schools of philosophers; a thing
complained of old by Tertullian, who plainly affirmed the philosophers
to be the patriarchs of the heretics.<a id="FNanchor_311_311" href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> To which agrees that observation
of Dr Owen, that those who either apologised for Christians, or
refuted the objections of the heathens against Christianity, frequently
cited the opinions or sentences of the philosophers, and accommodated
them to their purpose, that so they might beget in their adversaries
more friendly persuasions towards the Christian religion, by evidencing
that the mysteries thereof were not absurd, nor dissonant from reason,
seeing they might be justified by the sayings of their own philosophers.
And ‘here was laid, in this design and its prosecution, (and
surely it pleased its undertakers not a little,) the foundation of that
evil which religion hath since groaned under, that men made bold
with the tremendous mysteries of Christianity, to accommodate them
unwarily to the notions of the Gentiles.’<a id="FNanchor_312_312" href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> And this the apostle Paul
foresaw in that caution he gave, Col. ii. 8, ‘Beware lest any man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of
men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.’ Certainly
the snare is neither unusual nor weak, where the caution is so
serious. It is a thing naturally pleasing, to be the inventor of any
new thing, or to make new discoveries in religion, to raise new hypotheses,
or to adventure in unbeaten paths, for a reconcilement of
religion to any notion or practice famous for its antiquity, or pretence
to beauty and decency. Men hug themselves when they can make
several things to hit right, and an exact suiting of parallels is instead
of demonstration. By this foolish delight the devil makes men bold
to make essays; and what doth answer their humour passeth current
for undoubted truth.</p>

<p>[5.] He doth sometime blind the understanding, <i>by working up
the affections to such an earnest opposition to some error, that in a
forward haste they cast the mind upon a contrary extreme</i>; so that
through a hasty, violent avoidance of one error, they are cast upon a
contrary, and, it may be, as dangerous as that they fly from. And this
the devil doth with great ease, having the plausible pretence of zeal
and care to truth, wherein the affections being highly engaged, the mind
in a careless confidence doth easily overshoot the truth, which commonly
lies in the middle, and thinks it doth well enough if it gives
the greatest contradiction to the error now to be abominated. Men
in this case, having their eyes only fixed upon what they would avoid,
consider not so much whither they are going, as from what they go.
So that seeking, as men in a fright, to avoid the pit that is before
them, they run backward into another behind them.</p>

<p>This is such a noted stratagem of Satan, that all men take notice
of it in the general, though all men do not improve the discovery for
their own particular caution. The wisest of men are often so befooled
by their violent resistance of an untruth, that they readily
overshoot themselves and miss the mark. The fathers, in the heat of
dispute, said many things so inconveniently, that those who come
after do see and lament these hasty oversights, and have no other
way to salve their credit but by giving this observation in excuse for
them. And it may be observed that some errors which have risen
from this root at first have so strongly fixed themselves, that they
have grown up to the great annoyance of the truth; while the contrary
errors that did occasion them are forgotten, and their memories
are perished. I shall but instance in one instead of many, and that
shall be Arianism. How sadly prevalent that hath been in its time,
all men know that know anything of church history. The Christian
world once groaned under it. But that which gave the first occasion
to Arius to fix himself in that error was the doctrine of Alexander,
who, discoursing of the unity in the Trinity too nicely, seemed to
justify the error of Sabellius, who had taught, as also Noetus before,
that there was but one person in the Trinity, called by divers names
of Father, Son, and Spirit, according to different occasions; the
Trinity, according to his doctrine, being not of persons, but of names
and functions. While Arius was dissatisfied with this account of the
Trinity, he ran to a contrary extreme; and that he might give the
highest proof of a Trinity of persons, he affirmed that Jesus Christ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
had a beginning, and that there was a time when he was not, &amp;c.
Thus Socrates speaks of the rise of that heresy.<a id="FNanchor_313_313" href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>We might further follow the footsteps of this device, and trace it
in most opinions; where we might find the humour of running to a
contrary extreme hath still either set up a contrary error, or at least
leavened the truth with harsh and unjustifiable expressions and explanations.
The disputes betwixt faith and works have been thus
occasioned and aggravated. Some speak so of faith, as if they slighted
works; others so urge a necessity of works, as if they intended to make
faith useless. Some talk of grace, to an utter contempt of morality;
others, on the contrary, magnify morality to the annihilating of
grace. Some in their practice acquiesce in the outward performance
of ordinances: if they pray or receive the sacraments, though never
so formally, they are at peace, supposing they have done all that is
required; others observing the mistake, and knowing that God looks
more to the performance of the soul and spirit than to the act of the
body, upon a pretence of worshipping God in spirit, throw off the
observation of his ordinances altogether. Neither is there anything
that doth more generally and apparently undo us in the present dissensions,
as many have complained, than men’s violent overdoing and
running to contrary extremes.</p>

<p>[6.] Satan <i>makes use of rewards or punishments, on the one hand
to bribe, or on the other to force the affections, and they being strongly
possessed, easily prevail with the understanding to give sentence accordingly</i>.
Men are soon persuaded to take that for truth which they
see will be advantageous to them. Some men indeed take up with a
profession of truth, which yet their hearts approve not; but the
advantages they have by their profession, do silence their dissatisfactions;
these are said to use the profession of truth as ‘a cloak of
covetousness,’ 2 Thes. ii. 5. But others go further, and are really
brought to an approbation of that doctrine or way that makes most
for their profit, their minds being really corrupted by a self-seeking
principle. They persuade themselves, where there is any contest
about doctrines, that that doctrine is true which is gainful, and will
accordingly dispute for it. Hence that expression in 1 Tim. vi. 5,
‘supposing that gain is godliness.’</p>

<p>To this may be added, that the affections are quickly sensible of
the ease and sensual gratifications of any doctrine, and these are
usually thrown into the same scale to make more weight. Men have
naturally a good liking to that doctrine that promiseth fair for ease,
liberty, gain, and honour; and this hath made it a usual piece of
Satan’s business in all ages to gild an error with outward advantages,
and to corrupt the mind by secret promises of advancement.</p>

<p>On the other side, he labours as much to prejudice truth, by representing
it as hazardous and troublesome to the professors of it. And
this not only affrights some from an open confession of the truth they
believe, but also, by the help of the affections, doth persuade some to
believe that to be an error, which unavoidably brings persecution
with it. By this engine are the minds of men turned about to think
well or ill of a doctrine presented to them. This is so well known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
that I shall forbear a further prosecution of this head, and go to the
next course that Satan takes to corrupt the judgment by the affections;
which he doth,</p>

<p>[7.] <i>By stirring up some particular passions, which in opinions do
usually more influence the understanding.</i> And here I shall only
insist upon these two, pride and anger, with the peculiar means that
Satan hath to engage them in his service.</p>

<p>That pride and anger are the two usual firebrands of contention
and fountains of error, all ages have acknowledged and bewailed.
These two companions in evil do so darken the mind, that the miserable
captive in whom they domineer is carried blindfold, he knows
not whither, nor how. Pride usually begins, and anger follows with
all its forces, to justify what pride hath undertaken. Hence the
apostle, in 1 Tim. vi. 4, rakes up all the concomitant filth of error,
as envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, and perverse disputings of
men, and lays them at the door of pride: ‘He is proud, knowing
nothing.’</p>

<p>For the engaging of these two thieves, that rob the understanding of
its light, Satan hath many artifices in readiness. Pride, which is
forward enough of itself, is soon excited by laying before it an opportunity
of a seeming rare discovery, or of advancing the glory of knowledge
above the common pitch, of being seen and admired as more
excellent than others, &amp;c.: for upon such unworthy grounds have some
dared to adventure upon strange notions; yet there is nothing that
doth more firmly engage it than contention or dispute: for though
the proper end of disputation be the sifting out of truth, yet such is
man’s pride, and Satan’s advantage by it, that it seldom attains its
true end in those that are engaged. Bystanders that keep their
minds calm and unbiased, may receive more satisfaction than the contenders
themselves; and there needs no other evidence of this than
the common experience which men have of our frequent contentions;
where we have confutations, answers and replies, and yet still all parties
continue in their opinions without conviction. So that they that
would unfeignedly seek truth, in my mind, take not the best course in
their pursuit, that presently engage themselves in a public dispute;
for the usual heats that are begot in a contention alienate their minds
from a just impartiality, and the dust they raise blinds their eyes, that
they discern not truly. Let us look into this artifice of engaging pride
by disputation, and by it the judgment. First we find that when a
humour of contending is raised, certain truths are neglected, as to
their improvement and practice; for so much of the strength of the
soul is laid out upon disputable questions, that little is left for more
weighty matters. Secondly, In disputes men’s credit is so concerned,
that it is a most difficult thing to preserve a faithful regard to verity,
especially where they are managed with affronts and contumelies.
They that by calm handling might be induced to acknowledge a mistake,
will scarce come near that point of ingenuity, when they must
be called fool, knave, or ass for their labour. Hence ordinarily,
though they profess otherwise, men seek rather victory than truth.
Thirdly, In disputes pride and passion are usually heightened, and the
stronger the passions are the weaker is the judgment. Eager alterca<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>tions
bring a confusion, both upon the matter of which they dispute
and upon the understanding that should judge. Fourthly, In the
heat of disputation, when the mind is inflamed, men usually behave
themselves like those in a fray, where they snatch and throw anything
that comes to hand, and never mind where it hits; they will affirm
or deny anything that may seem any way to bring them off.
Fifthly, These assertions being once affirmed must be maintained, and
so errors and contentions increase without end. Disputes fix a man
in his persuasion, and do, as it were, tie him to the stake, so that
right or wrong he will go through with it. Sixthly, Some dispute in
jest against their present judgment, and yet at last dispute themselves
into a belief of what they wantonly at first affirmed; as some tell lies
so long, that at length they believe them to be true. Seventhly, A
sadder mischief often follows a disputing humour, which is a hazard
of the loss of all truth. Men dispute so long till they suspect all
things, and after a long trade of scepticism turn atheists.<a id="FNanchor_314_314" href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>After the same manner doth the devil engage anger in all disputes
and controversies, for it keeps company with pride, wherever there is
a provocation. And besides this, anger stirring up injuries and
wrongs, hath often engaged men, as it were in revenge, to change
their opinion, and to take up another way or doctrine. Nay, often
that simple mixture of pride and anger which we call emulation,
hath privately tainted the integrity of mind, and prepared it for
the next fair opportunity of error. This is noted of Arius, by
Theodoret, that when Alexander was chosen bishop of Alexandria,
he envied him the preferency, and from thence sought occasions of
contention, which after a little while the devil brought to his hand, as
we have heard.<a id="FNanchor_315_315" href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>So great is the power of these two passions over the understanding,
that we have cause to wonder at their success. Seldom or never can
it be shewn that any ringleader in error was not visibly tainted with
pride, or not apparently soured with discontents and emulation.</p>

<p>[8.] To these ways of blinding the understanding by the affections
I shall add but one more, which is this: Satan endeavours mainly to
<i>adorn an error with truth’s clothing</i>. He takes its ornaments and
jewels to dress up a false doctrine, that it may look more lovely and
dutiful; I mean that he designs, where errors are capable of such an
imitation, to put them into the way, method, garb, and manner which
truth doth naturally use. If truth be adorned with zeal, order, strictness,
or have advantageous ways of managing itself, error must
straightway imitate it in all these things; and though he that looks
near may easily discern that it is not the natural complexion of error,
but an artificial varnish, and such as doth no more become it than a
court dress doth become a coarse, clownish, country person—for you
may at first look usually discover the wolf under sheep’s clothing, and
under the garb of the apostles of Christ you may see the ministers of
Satan—yet are the credulous usually affected with these appearances.
If they find a professed strictness, a seeming severity, an imitation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
the ways of truth, or of the fruits thereof, they commonly seek no further,
but judge that to be truth which doth the things that truth doth;
and if error can handsomely stand in competition with truth, upon a
pretence of being as effectual in good works, and doing things of themselves
lovely and of good report, it doth much gain upon the good
liking of those whose consideration leads them not much further than
fair appearances. I shall only exemplify this by the art and policy
which Julian used to set up paganism, and to ruin Christianity; and
those who have observed the ways which he took to gain his end, will
readily acknowledge he was as well skilled in advancing error and
suppressing truth as any whosoever, and knew exactly to suit his
designs to men’s inclinations. He observing that Christian religion
had some particular things in its practice and way which made its
face to shine, as that it had persons solemnly set apart by ordination
for teaching the mysteries of the gospel, and for managing the public
worship of God; that these persons were to be grave in their carriage,
and exemplary in a strict holy conversation; that the constitutions of
religion appointed certain necessary and effectual ways of discipline,
for punishment, and restoring of offenders, and bringing them to
repentance; that it took care of the comfortable maintenance of those
that had given up themselves to the ministry of the word and prayer;
that it also enjoined a relief of the poor and strangers, &amp;c.: taking
notice, I say, of these excellencies in Christianity, and how lovely they
were in the eyes of their enemies, he appointed the like constitutions
for paganism, and ordained that the idol temples should be suited in
conveniency and comeliness to Christian churches: that there should
be seats and desks for the chief doctors and readers of Gentilism, who
at set times were to exhort the people and pray with them; and that
colleges and monasteries should be erected for them, and for the relief
of the poor and strangers; he commanded discipline and penances for
the chastisement of offenders; he required that their priests should
seriously give up themselves to the worship of God, as also their
families, that they should not frequent shows and taverns, nor practise
any infamous trade and art. Thus Sozomen reports him,<a id="FNanchor_316_316" href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> and
gives us a copy of his letter to Arsacius, high priest of Galatia, to this
purpose; and all this he did to bring Gentilism into credit with the
vulgar, whom he had observed to be affected to Christianity for its
order, strictness, and government.</p>

<p>Yet is not this the only instance that may be given in this kind:
for observe but any error that by schism sets up for itself in a distinct
party, and you shall see that though it departs from the truth of
the church, and from its communion, yet still, as the Israelites did
with the Egyptians, it carries away with it these jewels of the church,
and keeps to some considerable part of the church’s way, though
modified according to its own bent, that it might have a lustre with
it, to make it taking with others.</p>

<p>These eight particulars are the most remarkable ways of Satan
whereby the affections are gained to a good liking of error, and by
them the judgment secondarily corrupted to call it truth.</p>

<p>We have viewed the ways of Satan by which he tempts to sin, by
which he withdraws men from duty and service, by which he corrupts
the mind through error. It only now remains that something be
spoken of his attempts against the peace and comfort of the children
of God.</p>

<p>That it is also one of Satan’s chief designs to cheat us of our
spiritual peace, may be fully evinced by a consideration of his malice,
the great concern of inward comfort to us, and the many advantages
which he hath against us by the disquiet of our minds.</p>

<p>1. First, Whosoever shall seriously consider the devil’s <i>implacable
malice, will easily believe that he so envies our happiness that he will
industriously rise up against all our comforts</i>. It is his inward fret
and indignation that man hath any interest in that happiness from
which he irrecoverably fell, and that the Spirit of God should produce
in the hearts of his people any spiritual joy or satisfaction in the belief
and expectation of that felicity; and therefore must it be expected
that his malice—heightened by the torment of his own guilt, which,
as some think, are those ‘chains of darkness’ in which he is reserved
at present ‘to the judgment of the great day,’ [2 Peter ii. 4,]—will
not, cannot leave this part of our happiness unattempted. He endeavours
to supplant us of our birthright, of our blessing, of our salvation,
and the comfortable hopes thereof. From his common
employment in this matter, the Scripture hath given him names, importing
an opposition to Christ and his Spirit in the ways they take
for our comfort and satisfaction. Christ is our advocate that pleads
for us; Satan is διάβολος, a calumniator. The Spirit intercedes for
us; Satan is κατήγορος τῶν ἀδελφῶν, ‘the accuser of the brethren,
who accuseth them before God night and day,’ Rev. xii. 10. The
Spirit is our comforter; Satan is our disturber, a Beelzebub who is
ever raking in our wounds, as flies upon sores. The apostle Paul had
his eye upon this when he was advising the Corinthians to receive
again the penitent incestuous person; his caution was most serious:
2 Cor. ii. 11, ‘Lest Satan get advantage of us,’ lest he deceive and
circumvent us; for his expression relates to men cunningly deceitful
in trade, that do overreach and defraud the unskilful, πλεονεκτηθῶμεν;
and the reason of this caution was the known and commonly
experienced subtlety of Satan, ‘for we are not ignorant of his devices,’
implying that he will, and frequently doth lie at catch to take all advantages
against us. Some indeed restrain these advantages to ver.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
10,<a id="FNanchor_317_317" href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> as if Paul only meant that Satan was designing to fix the
Corinthians upon an opinion, that backsliders into great sins were
not to be received again, or that he laid in wait to raise a schism in
the church upon the account of this Corinthian. Others<a id="FNanchor_318_318" href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> restrain
this advantage which he waited for to ver. 7, where the apostle expresseth
his fear lest the excommunicated person should ‘be swallowed
up of too much sorrow;’ but the caution being not expressly
bound up to any one of these, seems to point at them all, and to tell
us that Satan drives on many designs at once, and that in this man’s
case Satan would endeavour to put the Corinthians upon a pharisaical
rigour, or to rend the church by a division about him, and to oppress
the penitent by bereaving him of his due comfort; so that it appears
still that it is one of his designs to hinder the comfort and molest the
hearts of God’s children.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, Of <i>such concern is inward spiritual peace to us</i>, that
it is but an easy conjecture to conclude from thence that so great an
adversary will make it his design to rob us of such a jewel; for,</p>

<p>[1.] Spiritual comfort is the <i>sweet fruit of holiness</i>, by which God
adorns and beautifies the ways of religious service, to render them
amiable and pleasant to the undertakers: ‘Her ways are ways of
pleasantness, and all her paths are peace,’ Prov. iii. 17; and this is
the present ‘rest and refreshment’ of God’s faithful servants under all
their toil, that when they have ‘tribulation from the world,’ yet they
have ‘peace in him,’ John xvi. 33; and that, being ‘justified by faith,
they have peace with God,’ and sometimes ‘joy unspeakable and full
of glory,’ 1 Peter i. 8; and this they may the more confidently expect,
because ‘the fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace,’ &amp;c., Gal. v. 22.</p>

<p>[2.] Spiritual comfort is not only our satisfaction, but our <i>inward
strength and activity; for all holy services doth depend upon it</i>. By
this doth God strengthen our heart and gird up our loins ‘to run the
ways of his commandments.’ It doth also strengthen the soul to
undergo afflictions, to glory in tribulations, to triumph in persecutions.
The outward man is also corroborated by the inward peace of
the mind: ‘A merry heart doth good like a medicine, but a broken
spirit drieth the bones,’ Prov. xvii. 22; all which are intended by
that expression, Neh. viii. 10, ‘The joy of the Lord is your strength;’
it is strength to the body, to the mind, and that both for service and
suffering; the reason whereof the apostle doth hint to us, Phil. iv. 7,
‘The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your
hearts and minds’—that is, peace doth so guard us as with a garrison,
φρουρήσει—for so much the word imports—that our affections,
our hearts, being entertained with divine satisfactions, are not easily
enticed by baser proffers of worldly delights, and our reasonings, our
minds, being kept steady upon so noble an object, are not so easily
perverted to a treacherous recommendation of vanities.</p>

<p>[3.] Joy and peace are propounded to our careful endeavours, for
attainment and preservation, <i>as a necessary duty of great importance
to us</i>. Rejoicings are not only recommended as seemly for the
upright, but enjoined as service, and that in the constant practice:
‘Rejoice evermore;’ ‘In everything give thanks,’ 1 Thes. v. 16, 18;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
‘Rejoice in the Lord alway; and again I say, rejoice,’ Phil. iv. 4.
In the Old Testament, God commanded the observation of several
feasts to the Jews. These, though they had their several respective
grounds from God’s appointment, yet the general design of all seems
to have been this, that ‘they might rejoice before the Lord their God,’
Lev. xxiii. 40; as if God did thereby tell them that it was the comely
complexion of religion, and that which was very acceptable to himself,
that his children might always serve him in cheerfulness of heart,
seeing such have more cause to rejoice than all the world besides.
They are then much mistaken that think mournful eyes and sad
hearts be the greatest ornaments of religion, or that none are serious
in the profession of it that have a cheerful countenance and a rejoicing
frame of spirit. It is true, there is a joy that is devilish, and a
mirth which is madness, to which Christ hath denounced a woe: ‘Woe
be to them that laugh now, for they shall mourn and weep,’ [Luke vi.
25]; but this is a joy of another nature, a carnal delight in vanity and
sin, by which men fatten their hearts to ruin; and whatsoever is said
against this can be no prejudice to spiritual, holy joy in God, his
favour and ways.</p>

<p>[4.] Spiritual comfort is also <i>a badge of our heavenly Father’s
kindness</i>. As Joseph, the son of his father’s affections, had a special
testimony thereof in his parti-coloured coat, so have God’s favourites
a peculiar token of his good-will to them when he gives them ‘the
garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness,’ [Isa. lxi. 7.] If
spiritual comfort be so advantageous to us, it will be no wonder to
see Satan so much rage against it. It would be a satisfaction to him
to tear these robes off us, to impede so needful a duty, to rob us
of so much strength, and to bereave us of the sweet fruits of our
labours.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, It further appears that Satan’s design is against the
comforts of God’s children, <i>by the many advantages he hath against
them, from the trouble and disquiet of their hearts</i>. I shall reckon up
the chief of them; as,</p>

<p>[1.] From the trouble of the spirit <i>he raiseth confusions and distractions
of mind</i>; for, (1.) It is as natural to trouble to raise up a
swarm of muddy thoughts as to ‘a troubled sea to cast up mire and
dirt;’ and hence is that comparison, Isa. lvii. 20; a thousand fearful
surmises, evil cogitations, resolves, and counsels immediately offer
themselves. This disorder of thoughts Christ took notice of in his
disciples when they were in danger, ‘Why do thoughts arise in your
hearts?’ Luke xxiv. 38. And David considered it as matter of great
anxiety, which called for speedy help: Ps. xciv. 19, ‘In the multitude
of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul.’ Sometimes
one fear is suggested, then presently another; now this doubt
perplexeth, then another question is begot by the former; they think
to take this course, then by and by they are off that, and resolve upon
another, and as quickly change again to a third, and so onward, one
thought succeeding another, as vapours from a boiling pot. (2.) Such
thoughts are vexatious and distracting, the very thoughts themselves,
being the poisonous steams of their running sores, are sadly afflictive,
and not unfitly called <i>cogitationes onerosæ</i>, burdensome thoughts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
But as they wrap up a man in clouds and darkness, as they puzzle him
in his resolves, nonplus him in his undertakings, distract him in his
counsels, disturb and hinder him in his endeavours, &amp;c., so do they bring
the mind into a labyrinth of confusion. What advantage the devil
hath against a child of God when his heart is thus divided and broken
into shivers, it is easy to imagine. And David seems to be very
sensible of it when he put up that request, Ps. lxxxvi. 11, ‘Unite my
heart to fear thy name.’</p>

<p>[2.] By disquiet of heart the devil <i>unfits men for duty or service</i>.
Fitness for duty lies in the orderly temper of body and mind, making
a man willing to undertake, and able to finish his work with comfortable
satisfaction. If either the body or mind be distempered, a man
is unfit for such an undertaking; both must be in a suitable frame,
like a well-tuned instrument, else there will be no melody. Hence,
when David prepared himself for praises and worship, he tells us his
‘heart was ready and fixed,’ and then ‘his tongue was ready also,’ so
was his hand with psaltery and harp; all these were awakened into a
suitable posture, Ps. xlv. 1, 2, and cviii. 1, 2. That a man is or hath
been in a fit order for service may be concluded from—(1.) His alacrity
to undertake a duty. (2.) His activity in the prosecution. (3.)
His satisfaction afterward, right grounds and principles in these
things being still presupposed. This being laid as a foundation, we
shall easily perceive how the troubles of the spirit do unfit us for
duty. For,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, These do take away all <i>alacrity and forwardness of the mind,
partly by diverting it from duty</i>. Sorrows when they prevail do so
fix the mind upon the present trouble, that it can think of nothing
but its burden; they confine the thoughts to the pain and smart, and
make a man forget all other things, as David in his trouble ‘forgot to
eat his bread,’ [Ps. cii. 4]; and sick persons willingly discourse only
of their diseases; partly by indisposing for action. Joy and hope are
active principles, but sorrow is sullen and sluggish. As the mind
in trouble is wholly employed in a contemplation of its misery, rather
than in finding out a way to avoid it, so if it be at leisure at any
time to entertain thoughts of using means for recovery, yet it is so tired
out with its burden, so disheartened by its own fears, so discouraged
with opposition and disappointment, that it hath no list to undertake
anything. By this means the devil brings the soul into a spiritual
catoche,<a id="FNanchor_319_319" href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> so congealing the spirits, that it is made stiff and deprived
of motion.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, Disquiets of heart unfit us for duty, <i>by hindering our
activity in prosecution of duty</i>. The whole heart, soul, and strength
should be engaged in all religious services, but these troubles are as
clogs and weights to hinder motion. Joy is the dilatation of the soul,
and widens it for anything which it undertakes; but grief contracts
the heart, and narrows all the faculties. Hence doth David beg an
‘enlarged heart,’ as the principle of activity: Ps. cxix. 32, ‘I will
run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart;’
for what can else be expected when the mind is so distracted with
fear and sorrow, but that it should be uneven, tottering, weak, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
confused? so that if it do set itself to anything, it acts troublesomely,
drives on heavily, and doth very little with a great deal ado; and yet,
were the unfitness the less, if that little which it can do were well
done, but the mind is so interrupted in its endeavours that sometimes
in prayer the man begins, and then is presently at a stand, and dare
not proceed, his words are ‘swallowed up, he is so troubled that he
cannot speak,’ Ps. lxxvii. 4. Sometimes the mind is kept so employed
and fixed on trouble, that it cannot attend in hearing or praying,
but presently the thoughts are called off, and become wandering.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, Troubles hinder <i>our satisfaction in duty, and by that means
unfit us to present duties, and indispose us to future services of that
kind</i>. Our satisfaction in duty ariseth, (1.) Sometimes from its own
lustre and sweetness, the conviction we have of its pleasantness, and
the spiritual advantages to be had thereby; these render it alluring
and attractive, and by such considerations are we invited to their performance,
as Isa. ii. 3, ‘Come ye, let us go up to the mountain of the
Lord; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.’
Hosea vi. 1, ‘Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath
torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up;’
but trouble of spirit draws a black curtain over the excellencies of duty,
and presents us with frightful thoughts about it, so that we judge of it
according to our fears, and make it frightful to ourselves, as if it would
be to no purpose—rather a mischief than an advantage. (2.) Sometime
our satisfaction ariseth from some special token of favour which
our indulgent Father lets fall upon us while we are in his work, as
when he gives us more than ordinary assistance, or puts joy and comfort
into our hearts. And this he often doth to make us come again,
and to engage afresh in the same or other services, as having ‘tasted
and seen that the Lord is gracious,’ [1 Pet. ii. 3,] and that there is a
blessedness in waiting for him. As in our bodies he so orders it that
the concocted juices become a successive ferment to those that succeed
from our daily meat and drink: so from duties performed doth he beget
and continue spiritual appetite to new undertakings. But oh how
sadly is all this hindered by the disquiet of the heart! The graces of
faith and love are usually obstructed, if not in their exercise, yet in
their delightful fruits, and if God offer a kindness, inward sorrow hinders
the perception: as when Moses told the Israelites of their deliverance,
‘they hearkened not for hard bondage,’ [Exod. vi. 9.] If a
message of peace present itself in a promise, or some consideration of
God’s merciful disposition, yet usually this is not credited. Job confesseth
so much of himself: Job xix. 16, ‘If I had called and he had
answered me, yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my
voice.’ David also doth the like: Ps. lxxvii. 2, 3, ‘My soul refuseth
to be comforted; I remembered God, and was troubled.’ Matter of
greatest comfort is often so far from giving ease, that it augments the
trouble. However, the heart is so hurried with its fears, and discomposed
with grief, that it cannot hearken to, nor consider, nor believe
any kind offer made to it.</p>

<p>By all these ways doth the devil, through the disquiet of mind,
unfit the Lord’s people for duty; and what a sad advantage this is
against us cannot easily be told. By this means he may widen the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
distance betwixt God and us, keep our wounds open, make us a
reproach to religion; and what not? But (3.) By these disquiets he
pusheth us on to reject all duties; for when he hath tired us out
by wearisome endeavours, under so great indispositions and unfitness,
he hath a fair advantage to tempt us to lay all aside. Our present
posture doth furnish him with arguments, he forgeth his javelins
upon our anvil, and they are commonly these three:—</p>

<p>[1.] That duties are <i>difficult</i>. And this is easily proved from our
own experience; while we are broken or bowed down with sorrows, we
make many attempts for duty, and are oft beat off with loss; our
greatest toil helps us but to very inconsiderable performances; hence,
he infers, it is foolishness to attempt that which is above our strength,
better sit still than toil for nothing.</p>

<p>[2.] That they are <i>unfruitful</i>; and this is our own complaint, for
troubled spirits have commonly great expectations from duties at
first, and they run to them, as the impotent and sick people to the
pool of Bethesda, with thoughts of immediate ease as soon as they
shall step into them; but when they have tried, and waited a while,
stretching themselves upon duty, as Elisha’s servant laid the staff upon
the face of the Shunammite’s son, and yet there is no voice nor hearing,
no answer from God, no peace, then are they presently dissatisfied,
reflecting on the promises of God and the counsels of good men, with
this, Where is all the pleasantness you speak of? what advantage
is it that we have thus run and laboured, when we have got nothing?
And then it is easy for the devil to add, And why do you wait on the
Lord any longer?</p>

<p>[3.] His last and most dangerous argument is, that they are <i>sinful</i>.
Unfitness for duty produceth many distractions, much deadness, wandering
thoughts, great interruptions, and pitiful performances. Hence
the troubled soul comes off from duty wounded and halting, more
distressed when he hath done than when he began; upon these considerations,
that all his service was sin, a mocking of God, a taking
his name in vain, nay, a very blasphemous affront to a divine majesty.
Upon this the devil starts the question to his heart, Whether it be
not better to forbear all duty, and to do nothing? Thus doth Satan
improve the trouble of the mind, and often with the designed success.
For a dejected spirit doth not only afford the materials of these
weapons which the devil frames against it, but is much prepared
to receive them into its own bowels. The grounds of these arguments
it grants, and the inferences are commonly consented to, so that
ordinarily duty is neglected, either, 1. Through sottishness of heart;
or, 2. Through frightful fears; or, 3. Through desperateness; bringing
a man to the very precipice of that atheistical determination, ‘I
have cleansed my hands in vain,’ [Ps. lxxiii. 13.]</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, Satan makes use of the troubles of God’s children as a
<i>stumbling-block to others</i>. It is no small advantage to him, that he
hath hereby an occasion to render the ways of God unlovely to those
that are beginning to look heavenward; he sets before them the sighs,
groans, complaints, and restless outcries of the wounded in spirit, to
scare them off from all seriousness in religion, and whispers this to
them, ‘Will you choose a life of bitterness and sorrow? can you eat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
ashes for bread, and mingle your drink with tears? will you exchange
the comforts and contents of life for a melancholy heart and a dejected
countenance? how like you to go mourning all the day, and at night
to be scared with dreams and terrified with visions? will you choose a
life that is worse than death, and a condition which will make you a
terror to yourselves and a burden to others? can you be in love with
a heart loaden with grief, and perpetual fears almost to distraction,
while you see others in the meantime enjoy themselves in a contented
peace? Thus he follows young beginners with his suggestions, making
them believe that they cannot be serious in religion, but at last
they will be brought to this, and that it is a very dangerous thing to
be religious overmuch, and the highway to despair; so that if they
must have a religion, he readily directs them to use no more of it
than may consist with the pleasures of sin and the world, and to make
an easy business of it, not to let sin lie over-near their heart, lest it disquiet
them; nor overmuch to concern themselves with study, reading,
prayer, or hearing of threatening, awakening sermons, lest it make
them mad; nor to affect the sublimities of communion with God,
exercises of faith and divine love, lest it discompose them and dash
their worldly jollities out of countenance. A counsel that is readily
enough embraced by those that are almost persuaded to be Christians;
and the more to confirm them in it, he sticks not sometime to asperse
the poor troubled soul with dissimulation—where that accusation
is proper, for the devil cares not how inconsistent he be with himself,
so that he may but gain his end—affirming all his seriousness to be
nothing but whining hypocrisy. So that whether they judge these
troubles to be real or feigned, his conclusion is the same, and he
persuades men thereby to hold off from all religious strictness, holy
diligence, and careful watchfulness.</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>, A further use which the devil makes of these troubles of
spirit is, <i>to prepare the hearts of men thereby to give entertainment
to his venomous impressions</i>. Distress of heart usually opens the door
to Satan, and lays a man naked, without armour or defence, as a fair
mark for all his poisoned arrows; and it is a hundred to one but some
of them do hit. I shall choose out some of the most remarkable, and
they are these:—</p>

<p>[1.] <i>After long acquaintance with grief he labours to fix them in it.</i>
In some cases custom doth alleviate higher griefs, and men take an
odd kind of delight in them; <i>Est quædam etiam dolendi voluptas</i>. It
is some pleasure to complain, and men settle themselves in such
a course, their finger is ever upon their sore, and they go about
telling their sorrows to all they converse with—though to some this is
a necessity, for real sorrows, if they be not too great for vent, will constrain
them to speak—yet in some that have been formerly acquainted
with grief, it degenerates at last into a formality of complaining; and
because they formerly had cause so to do, they think they must always
do so. But besides this, Satan doth endeavour to chain men to their
mourning upon two higher accounts<a id="FNanchor_320_320" href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>: 1. By a delusive contentment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
in sorrow, as if our tears paid some part of our debt to God, and made
amends for the injuries done to him. 2. By an obstinate sullenness
and desperate resolvedness they harden themselves in sorrow, and say
as Job, chap. vii. 11, ‘I will not refrain my mouth, I will speak in the
anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?’</p>

<p>[2.] Another impression that men’s hearts are apt to take, is, <i>unthankfulness
for the favours formerly bestowed upon them</i>. Their
present troubles blot out the memory of old kindnesses. They conclude
they have nothing at all, because they have not peace. Though God
heretofore hath sent down from on high, and taken them out of the
great waters, or out of the mire and clay where they were ready to
sink; though he hath sent them many tokens of love, conferred on
them many blessings; yet all these are no more to them, so long as
their sorrows continue, than Haman’s wealth and honour was to
him, so long as Mordecai the Jew sat at the king’s gate. Thus the
devil oft prevails with God’s children, to deal with God as some
unthankful persons deal with their benefactors; who, if they be not
humoured in every request, deny the reality of their love, and despise
with great ingratitude all that was done for them before.</p>

<p>[3.] By inward griefs, the heart of the afflicted are prepared to
entertain <i>the worst interpretation that the devil can put upon the
providences of God</i>. The various instances of Scripture, and the
gracious promises made to those that ‘walk in darkness and see no
light,’ do abundantly forewarn men from making bad conclusions of
God’s dealings, and do tell us that God in design, for our trial and for
our profit, doth often hide his face ‘for a moment,’ when yet his purpose
is to ‘bind us up with everlasting compassions.’ Now the devil
labours to improve the sorrows of the mind to give a quite contrary
construction. If they are afflicted, instead of saying, ‘Sorrow may
endure for a night, but joy will come in the morning,’ [Ps. xxx. 5,]
or that ‘for a little while God hath hidden himself,’ he puts them to
say, ‘this darkness shall never pass away.’ If the grief be little, he
drives them on to a fearful expectation of worse; as he did with
Hezekiah, Isa. xxxviii. 13, ‘I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion,
so will he break all my bones; from day even to night wilt thou make
an end of me.’ If God purpose to teach us by inward sorrows our
pride of heart, carelessness, neglect of dependence upon him, the
bitterness of sin, or the like, the devil will make us believe, and we
are too ready to subscribe to him, that God proclaims open war against
us, and resolves never to own us more. So did Job, chap. xix. 6,
‘Know now that God hath overthrown me, and compassed me with
his net;’ how often complained he, ‘thou hast made me as thy mark,
thou hast broken me asunder, thou hast taken me by my neck and
shaken me to pieces’! So also Heman, Ps. lxxxviii. 14, ‘Why castest
thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?’</p>

<p>[4.] Upon this occasion the devil is ready to envenom the soul <i>with
sinful wishes and execrations against itself</i>. Eminent saints have
been tempted in their trouble to say too much this way. Job solemnly
cursed his day: Job iii. 3, ‘Let the day perish wherein I was born,
and the night in which it was said, There is a man-child conceived,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
&amp;c. So also Jeremiah, chap. xx. 14, ‘Cursed be the day wherein I
was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.
Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man-child
is born unto thee; and let that man be as the cities which God
overthrew, and repented not.’ Strange rashness! what had the day
deserved? or wherein was the messenger to be blamed? Violent
passions hurried him beyond all bounds of reason and moderation.
When troubles within are violent, a small push sets men forward; and
when once they begin, they are carried headlong beyond what they
first intended.</p>

<p>[5.] On this advantage the devil sometimes emboldens them to
<i>quarrel God himself directly</i>. When Job and Jeremiah cursed their
day, it was a contumely against God indirectly; but they durst not
make bold with God at so high a rate as to quarrel him to his face.
Yet even this are men brought to often when their sorrows are long-lasting
and deep. The devil suggests, Can God be faithful, and never
keep promise for help? can he be merciful, when he turns away his
ears from the cry of the miserable? where is his pity, when he multiplies
his wounds without cause? Though at first these cursed intimations
do a little startle men, yet when by frequent inculcating they
grow more familiar to the heart, the distressed break out in their
rage with those exclamations, Where is the faithfulness of God?
where are his promises? hath he not forgotten to be gracious? are
not his mercies clean gone? And at last it may be Satan leads them
a step higher, that is—</p>

<p>[6.] <i>To a despairing desperateness.</i> For when all passages of relief
are stopped up, and the burden becomes great, men are apt to be
drawn into rage and fury when they think their burden is greater
than they can bear, and see no hope of ease; in a kind of revenge they
express their anger against the hand that wounded them. The devil
is officiously ready with his advice of ‘Curse God and die,’ [Job.
ii. 9,] and they, being full of anguish, are quickly made to comply
with it.</p>

<p>[7.] When it is at this height, the devil hath but one stage more,
and that is the suggesting of <i>irregular means for ease</i>. Rage against
God doth not quench the inward burning, blasphemies against heaven
easeth not the pain, the sore runs still and ceaseth not, the trouble
continues, the man cannot endure it longer, all patience and hope is
gone. What shall he do in this case? The devil offers his service;
he will be the physician, and commonly he prescribes one of these
two things: (1.) That it is best to endeavour to break through all
this trouble into a resolved profaneness; not to stand in awe of laws,
not to believe that there is a God that governs in the earth, but that
this is only the bitter fruit of melancholy and unnecessary seriousness,
and therefore it is best ‘to eat, drink, and be merry,’ If a man can
thus escape out of his trouble, the devil needs no more; but oft he
cannot, the wounds of conscience will not be thus healed. Then,
(2.) He hath another remedy, which will not fail, as he tells them,
that is, to ‘destroy themselves,’ to end their troubles with their lives.
How open are the breasts of troubled creatures to all these darts!
and were it not that God secretly steps in and holds the afflicted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
his right hand, it is scarce imaginable but that wounded consciences
should by Satan’s subtle improvement of so fair an advantage be
brought to all this misery.</p>

<p>[8.] Satan can afflict the <i>body by the mind</i>. For these two are so
closely bound together that their good and bad estate is shared betwixt
them. If the heart be merry the countenance is cheerful, the strength
is renewed, the bones do flourish like an herb. If the heart be troubled
the health is impaired, the strength is dried up, the marrow of the
bones wasted, &amp;c. Grief in the heart is like a moth in the garment,
it insensibly consumeth the body and disordereth it. This advantage
of weakening the body falls into Satan’s hands by necessary consequence,
as the prophet’s ripe figs, that fell into the mouth of the eater.
And surely he is well pleased with it, as he is an enemy both to body
and soul. But it is a greater satisfaction to him in that as he can
make the sorrows of the mind produce the weakness and sickness of
the body, so can he make the distemper of the body, by a reciprocal
requital, to augment the trouble of the mind. How little can a
sickly body do! It disables a man for all services; he cannot oft
pray, nor read, nor hear; sickness takes away the sweetness and comfort
of religious exercises. This gives occasion for them to think the
worse of themselves. They think the soul is weary of the ways of
God, when the body cannot hold out. All failures which weariness
and faintness produce are ascribed presently to the bad disposition of
the mind, and this is like oil cast upon the flame. Thus the devil
makes a double gain out of spiritual trouble.</p>

<p>[9.] Let it be also reckoned among the advantages which Satan
hath against men from trouble of spirit, that it is <i>a contentment to him
to see them in their miseries</i>. It is a sport to him to see them, as Job
speaks, take their flesh in their teeth, and cry out in the bitterness of
their souls, [Job. xiii. 14.] Their groanings are his music. When
they wallow in ashes, drown themselves in tears, roar till their throat
is dry, spread out their hands for help, then he gluts his heart in
looking upon their woes. When they fall upon God with their unjust
surmises, evil interpretations of providence, questioning his favour,
denying his grace, wishing they had never been born, then he claps
his hands and shouts a victory. The pleasantest sight to him is to
see God hiding himself from his child, and that child broken with
fears, torn in pieces with griefs, made a brother to dragons, a companion
to owls, under restless anxieties, perpetual lamentations, feeble
and sore broken, their strength dried like a potsherd, their throat dry,
their tongue cleaving to their jaws, their bowels boiling, their bones
burnt with heat, their skin black upon them, their flesh consumed,
their bones sticking out, chastened with strong pain upon their bed.
This is one of Satan’s delightful spectacles, and for these ends
doth he all he can to bereave them of their comfort, which we may
the more certainly persuade ourselves to be true, when we consider
the grounds forementioned, his malicious nature, the advantages of
spiritual peace, and the disadvantages of spiritual trouble.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VI_2">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of the various ways by which he hinders peace—</i>1. <i>Way by discomposures
of spirit. These discomposures explained, by shewing,</i> (1.)
<i>What advantage he takes from our natural temper, and what tempers
give him this advantage.</i> (2.) <i>By what occasions he works upon
our natural tempers.</i> (3.) <i>With what success.</i> [1.] <i>These occasions
suited to natural inclinations, raise great disturbance. </i>[2.] <i>They
have a tendency to spiritual trouble. The thing proved, and the
manner how discovered. </i>[3.] <i>These disturbances much in his power.
General and particular considerations about that power.</i></p>


<p>Having evidenced that one of Satan’s principal designs is against
the peace and comfort of God’s children, I shall next endeavour a discovery
of the various ways by which he doth undermine them herein.
All inward troubles are not of the same kind in themselves, neither
doth Satan always produce the same effects out of all; some being in
their own nature disquiets, that do not so directly and immediately
overthrow the peace and joy of believing, and the comforts of assurance
of divine favour, as others do. Yet seeing that by all he hath no
small advantage against us as to sin and trouble, and that any of them
at the long run may lead us to question our interest in grace and the
love of God, and may accordingly afflict us, I shall speak of them
all; which that I may do the more distinctly, I shall rank these
troubles into several heads, under peculiar names—it may be not altogether
so proper but that the curious may find matter of exception to
them—that by them and their explanation the differences may the
better appear. I distinguish therefore of a fourfold trouble that the
devil doth endeavour to work up upon the hearts of men. They are,
1. Discomposures. 2. Affrightments. 3. Dejections of sadness. 4.
Distresses of horror. Of all which I shall speak in their order.
And,</p>

<p>1. <i>Of discomposures of soul.</i> These are molestations and disturbances
by which the mind is put out of order and made unquiet. The
calm in which it should enjoy itself, and by which it should be composed
to a regular and steady acting, being disturbed by a storm of
commotion, and in which the conscience or the peace of it is not presently
concerned. This distinction of the trouble of soul from the
trouble of conscience is not new. Others have observed it before,<a id="FNanchor_321_321" href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> and
do thus explain it: Trouble of soul is larger than trouble of conscience;
every troubled conscience is a troubled soul, but every
troubled soul is not a troubled conscience; for the soul may be
troubled from causes natural, civil, and spiritual, according to variety
of occasions and provocations, when yet a man’s inward peace with
God is firm; and in some cases, as in infants and in men distracted
with fevers, &amp;c., there may be passions and disturbances of soul when
the conscience is not capable of exercising its office: nay, the soul of
Christ was troubled—John xii. 27, ‘Now is my soul troubled’—when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
it was not possible that sin or despair should have the least footing
in him.</p>

<p>For the opening of these discomposures of soul I shall—1. Shew
upon what advantage of natural temper the devil is encouraged to
molest men. 2. By what occasions he doth work upon our natural
inclinations. 3. And with what success of disturbance to the soul.</p>

<p>(1.) As to our natural dispositions, Satan, as hath formerly been
noted, <i>takes his usual indications of working from thence</i>. These
guide him in his enterprises; his temptations being suited to men’s
tempers, proceed more smoothly and successfully. Some are of so
serene and calm a disposition, that he doth not much design their
discomposure; but others there are whose passions are more stirring—fit
matter for him to work upon: and these are,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>The angry disposition.</i> How great an advantage this gives to
Satan to disturb the heart, may be easily conceived by considering the
various workings of it in several men, according to their different
humours. It is a passion that acts not alike in all; and for the differences,
so far as we need to be concerned, I shall not trouble the
schools of philosophers, but content myself with what we have in Eph.
iv. 31, where the apostle expresseth it by three words, not that they
differ essentially, declaring thereby the various ways of anger’s working.
The first is πικρία, which we translate <i>bitterness</i>. This is a
displeasure smothered; for some when they are angry cover it, and
give it no vent, partly for that they are sometimes ashamed to mention
the ground as trivial or unjust, partly from sullenness of disposition,
and oft from a natural reservedness; while the flame is thus kept
down, it burns inwardly, and men resolve<a id="FNanchor_322_322" href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> in their minds many troublesome,
vexatious thoughts. The second word is θυμὸς, <i>wrath</i>; this is
a fierce, impetuous anger. Some are soon moved, but so violent that
they are presently transported into rage and frenzy, or are so peevishly
waspish that they cannot be spoken to. The third is ὀργὴ, translated
here <i>anger</i>, but signifies such a displeasure as is deep, entertaining
thoughts of revenge and pursuit, settling itself at last into hatred.
Any of these is enough to bereave the heart of its rest, and to alarm
it with disturbances.<a id="FNanchor_323_323" href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></p>

<p>[2.] Others have an <i>envious nature, always maligning and repining
at other men’s felicity</i>; an evil eye that cannot look on another’s better
condition without vexation. This turns a man into a devil. It is the
devil’s proper sin, and the fury that doth unquiet him, and he the
better knows of what avail it would be to help on our trouble.</p>

<p>[3.] Some are <i>of proud tempers</i>, always overvaluing themselves, with
the scorn and contempt of others. This humour is troublesome to all
about them, but all this trouble doth at last redound to themselves.
These think all others should observe them, and take notice of their
supposed excellencies, which if men do not, then it pines them or stirs
up their choler to indignation. Solomon, Prov. xxx. 21, mentioning
those things that are greatly disquieting in the earth, instanceth in
‘a servant when he reigneth; and the handmaid that is heir to her
mistress,’ intending thereby the proud, imperious insolency of those
that are unexpectedly raised from a low estate to wealth or honour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
He that is of ‘a proud heart stirreth up strife,’ Prov. xxviii. 25; and
as he is troublesome to others, so doth he create trouble to himself;
for he not only molests himself by the working of his disdainful
thoughts, while he exerciseth his scorn towards others: Prov. xxi. 24,
‘The haughty scorner deals in proud wrath;’ but this occasions the
affronts and contempt of others again, which beget new griefs to his
restless mind.</p>

<p>[4.] Some have a natural <i>exorbitancy of desire, an evil coveting</i>;
they are passionately carried forth toward what they have not, and
have no contentment or satisfaction in what they do enjoy. Such
humours are seldom at ease, their desires are painfully violent; and
when they obtain what they longed for, they soon grow weary of it,
and then another object takes up their wishes, so that these ‘daughters
of the horse-leech are ever crying, Give, give,’ Prov. xxx. 15.</p>

<p>[5.] Others have <i>a soft effeminate temper, a weakness of soul that
makes them unfit to bear any burden, or endure any hardness</i>. These,
if they meet with pains or troubles—and who can challenge an exemption
from them?—they are presently impatient, vexing themselves by
a vain reluctancy to what they cannot avoid; not but that extraordinary
burdens will make the strongest spirit to stoop, but these cry
out for the smallest matters, which a stout mind would bear with some
competent cheerfulness.</p>

<p>[6.] And there are other dispositions that <i>are tender to an excess of
sympathy</i>, so that they immoderately affect and afflict themselves with
other men’s sorrows. Though this be a temper more commendable
than any of the former, yet Satan can take advantage of this, as also
of the fore-named dispositions, to discompose us, especially by suiting
them with fit occasions, which readily work upon these tempers. And
this was,</p>

<p>(2.) The second thing to be explained, which shall be performed by
a brief enumeration of them, the chief whereof are these:</p>

<p>[1.] <i>Contempt or disestimation.</i> When a man’s person, parts, or
opinion are slighted, his anger, envy, pride, and impatience are
awakened, and these make him swell and restless within. Even good
men have been sadly disturbed this way. Job, as holy a man as he
was, and who had enough of greater matters to trouble his mind, yet
among other griefs complains of this more than once: Job xii. 4, ‘I
am as one mocked of his neighbour: the just upright man is laughed
to scorn;’ chap. xix. 15, ‘They that dwell in mine house, and my
maids, count me for a stranger. I called my servant, and he gave
me no answer. Yea, young children despised me; I rose up and they
spake against me.’ Thus he bemoans himself, and, which is more,
speaks of it again with some smartness of indignation: Job xxx. 1,
‘Now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers
I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.’ David
also, who had a stout heart under troubles, complains that he could
not bear reproaches: Ps. lxix., ‘Reproach hath broken mine heart; I
am full of heaviness.’ What these reproaches were, and how he was
staggered with them, he tells us: ver. 10, ‘I chastened my soul with
fasting, that was to my reproach. I made sackcloth my garment;
and I became a proverb to them. They that sit in the gate speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.’ With these he
was so stounded that if he had not catched hold on God by prayer, as
he speaks, ver. 13, he had fallen, ‘But as for me, my prayer is unto
thee, O Lord,’ &amp;c.; and he afterward speaks of his support under
reproaches as a wonder of divine assistance: Ps. cxix. 51, ‘The
proud have had me in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.’</p>

<p>[2.] <i>Injury</i> is another occasion by which the devil works upon our
tempers to disquiet us. Wrongs of injustice and oppression are hard
to bear. This is a common ground of trouble. Good men cannot
always acquit themselves in this case as they ought. Jeremiah, when
smitten by Pashur, and put in the stocks, Jer. xx. 2, 8, falls into a
sad passion: ‘I am a derision daily, every one mocketh me. I cried
out, I cried violence and spoil,’ imitating the passionate affrightments
of those that cry, Murder, murder, &amp;c. No wonder, seeing Solomon
gives it as an axiom built upon manifold experience, Eccles. vii. 7.
Oppression doth not only make a man unquiet, but mad in his unquietness;
and not only those that are foolish and hasty, but the most
considerate and sedate persons: ‘Oppression makes a wise man mad.’</p>

<p>[3.] Another occasion of men’s discomposure is, <i>the prosperity of the
wicked</i>. Their abundance, their advancements to honours and dignity,
hath always been a grudge to those whose condition is below them,
and yet suppose themselves to have better grounds to expect preferment
than they. This astonished Job even to trembling: Job xxi. 7,
‘When I remember, I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my
flesh;’ and the matter was but this, ‘Wherefore do the wicked live,
become old, yea, and mighty in power?’ &amp;c. The trouble that seizeth
on men’s hearts on this occasion is called fretting, a vexation that
wears out the strength of the soul, as two hard bodies waste by mutual
attrition or rubbing. And it takes its advantage from our envy chiefly,
though other distempers come in to help it forward: Ps. xxxvii. 1,
‘Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against
the workers of iniquity.’ David confesseth that he was apt to fall
into this trouble, Ps. lxxiii. 3, ‘I was envious at the foolish, when I
saw the prosperity of the wicked.’ Against this disquiet we have
frequent cautions, Prov. xxiv. 1, 19, and Ps. xlix. 16, ‘Be not afraid
when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased.’ All
which shew our proneness to this disease.</p>

<p>[4.] <i>Crosses and afflictions give Satan an opportunity to work upon
our passions</i>; as disappointments of expectations, loss of friends, of
estate, persecutions and sufferings for conscience sake, &amp;c. None of
these in their own nature are ‘joyous, but grievous;’ and what use
they have been of to the devil to discompose the minds of the sufferers,
is evidenced by common experience. The tears, sad countenances,
and doleful lamentations of men are true witnesses of the disquiet of
their hearts. Every one being pressed with the sense of his own
smart is ready to cry out, ‘Is there any sorrow like my sorrow? I
am poor and comfortless; my lovers and my friends have forsaken me,
and there is none to help.’ Some grow faint under their burden, while
their eyes fail in looking for redress, especially when new unexpected
troubles overwhelm their hopes: ‘When I looked for good, then evil
came; and when I waited for light, there came darkness,’ Job xxx. 26.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
‘Why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We
looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing,
and behold trouble,’ Jer. xiv. 19; and here they sink, concluding there
is no hope. Others that bear up better in a blessed expectation of
spiritual profit, having that of David in their eye, ‘Blessed is the man
whom thou afflictest, and teachest in thy law;’ yet they cannot forbear
their complaints even to God; Ps. xxv. 17, ‘The troubles of
mine heart are enlarged; oh bring thou me out of my distresses; look
upon mine affliction and my pain.’ Nay,<a id="FNanchor_324_324" href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> those that have had the
highest advantages of heavenly support, whose hearts have been kept in
peace, counting it all joy that they have fallen into these trials—and
God doth more this way for those that suffer for the gospel’s sake
than ordinarily for others; yet have not these been under a stoical
senselessness of their trouble. Though they were not ‘distressed,’
they were ‘troubled on every side;’ though ‘not in despair,’ yet they
were ‘perplexed,’ 2 Cor. iv. 8; though their afflictions were light, yet
were they afflictions still.</p>

<p>[5.] To these may be added, <i>the pain or anguish of sickness and
bodily distemper</i>. Though there are various degrees of pain, and that
some sicknesses are less afflictive than others, yet none of them forbear
to pierce the mind. The whole man is discomposed. He that is
exercised with ‘strong pains upon his bed,’ cries out in the bitterness
of his soul; and he that by insensible degrees languisheth, grows
ordinarily peevish, and his mind bleeds by an inward wound, so that he
‘spends his days in sighing,’ and his years in mourning. And others
there are who, being before acquainted with bodily pains, grow very
impatient in sickness, and are able to bear nothing. And besides the
present sense of pain, the expectation of death puts some into great
commotion; the fears of it, for it is naturally dreadful, fills them with
disquiet thoughts; and those that approach to the grave by slow steps,
under consumption or languishing sicknesses, they are habituated to
sadness, and can think of nothing cheerfully—except they have great
assurance of salvation, and have well learned to die—because the
coffin, grave, and winding-sheet are still presented to them. These,
though they be very suitable objects for meditation, and, well improved,
of great advantage for preparation to death, yet doth Satan thereby,
when it is for his purpose, endeavour to keep men under grief, and to
bereave them of their peace.</p>

<p>[6.] Satan takes an advantage of trouble from <i>the miseries of others</i>.
Sympathy is a Christian grace; and to bear one another’s burdens, to
mourn with those that mourn, shews us to be fellow-feeling members of
the same body; for ‘if one member suffer, all the members suffer with
it,’ [1 Cor. xii. 26.] Yet are some men naturally of so tender a constitution,
that Satan overdrives them herein. Every common occasion
will wound them. The usual effects of God’s ordinary providence on
the poor, lame, or sick, are deeply laid to heart by them; and instead
of being not unsensible of other men’s miseries, they are not sensible
of anything else, neither do they enjoy their own mercies. And here,
as Satan can every moment present them with objects of pity, ordinary
or extraordinary, so upon a religious pretence of merciful consideration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
they are made cruel to themselves, refusing their own peace, because
other men are not at ease.</p>

<p>(3.) The third particular promised to be explained for the discovery
of these discomposures of soul was this, that by <i>a concurrence of these
and such like occasions to such tempers, the hearts of men are disturbed,
and their inward peace broken</i>. This I shall evidence of these three
things: 1. That these occasions meeting with such dispositions, do
naturally raise great disturbances in their present working; 2. That
they have a tendency to further trouble; 3. That Satan doth design,
and hath it ordinarily in his power, to discompose the hearts of men
hereby.</p>

<p>[1.] That these occasions meeting with such dispositions, do naturally
raise <i>great disturbances</i>. This is evident from what hath been said
already; for (1.) <i>All these dispositions carry as much fire in their own
bosoms, as is sufficient to burn up the standing corn of any man’s peace.</i>
What is anger, but an inward burning, a restless confusion of the
spirits? sometime a frenzy, a distraction, a troubled sea full of rage, a
wild beast let loose. Envy, that is a fretful peevishness, a vexatious
repining, needing no other tormentors but its own furies, recoiling upon
him that bred it, because it cannot wreak its spite upon its objects.
An envious person is a self-murderer, by the verdict of Eliphaz: Job
v. 2, ‘Wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the foolish
one.’ This is not barely to be understood of its provoking the judge
of all the earth to send down its deserved destruction; but also, if not
chiefly, of its own corroding temper, which by long continuance wastes
the strength and consumes the body. Pride is a perpetual vexation,
creating its troubles from its own fancy. Irregular covetings keep a
man still upon the rack; they make a man like the Tantalus of the
poets; they give a man a <i>caninus appetitus</i>, a strong appetite with excessive
greediness, and restless pursuit, and constant dissatisfactions;
he is ever gaping, and never enjoying. Impatience is a wearisome
conflict with a burden which it can neither bear nor yet shake off;
where all the fruit of the vain labour amounts to no better account
than this, that the impatient makes his burden the greater, the bands
that tie it on the stronger, and the strength that should bear it the
weaker. Lastly, An excess of pity multiplies ‘wounds without cause.’
It hinders a man to be happy so long as there are any that are miserable.
He is always, in reference to his quiet, at the mercy of other
men. The afflicted can torment him at a distance; and, by a kind of
magic, make him feel the torments that are inflicted upon his image.
Who can deny but that men that are ridden by such vexatious dispositions
must lead an unquiet life, and always be tossed with inward
tempests? Especially, (2.) When we consider <i>how fit the fore-mentioned
occasions are to draw out these humours to their tumultuary extravagances</i>.
A lighted match and gunpowder are not more exactly suited
to raise a shaking blast, than those occasions and tempers are to
breed an inward annoyance. Some of these humours are so troublesome,
that rather than they will want work, they will fight with their
own shadows, and, by a perverseness of prejudicated fancy, will create
their own troubles; and the best of them, which seem sometime to
take truce and compose themselves to rest, while occasions are out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
the way; yet they are quickly awakened, like sleeping dogs that are
roused with the least noise. What work, then, may we expect they
will make when they are summoned to give their appearance upon a
solemn occasion? But (3.) If we should deal by instances, and bring
upon the stage the effects that have been brought forth by these concurring
causes, it will appear that they make disturbances in good
earnest. Let us either view <i>the furious fits that have been, like sudden
flashes, soonest gone</i>, or their more lasting impressions, and we shall
find it true. As to violent fits raised by such occasions and dispositions,
examples are infinite. What rages, outrages, madnesses, and
extravagances have men run into! Some, upon provocations, have
furiously acted savage cruelties, and for small matters have been
carried to the most desperate revenges. Others have been brought to
such violent commotions within themselves, that the frame of nature
hath been thereby weakened and overthrown. As Sylla, who in a
strong passion vomited choler till he died. Some in their fury have
acted that which hath been matter of sorrow to them all their days.
But, omitting the examples of heathens and wicked men, let us consider
the wonderful transports of holy men. Moses, a man eminent beyond
comparison in meekness, was so astonished with a sudden surprise of
trouble at the sight of the golden calf, that he threw down the tables
of the law, and brake them. Some indeed observe from thence a significancy
of Israel’s breaking the law and forfeiting God’s protection
as his peculiar people; but this is more to be ascribed to the designment
of divine providence, that so ordered it, than to the intendment
of Moses, who no doubt did not this from a sedate and calm deliberation,
as purposing by this act to tell Israel so much; but was hurried
by his grief, as not considering well what he did, to break them. Asa,
a good man, when he was reproved by the prophet, instead of thankful
acceptance of the reproof, grows angry, falls into a rage, and throws the
prophet into prison. Elias, discomposed with Jezebel’s persecution,
desires that God would take away his life. Jonah, in his anger, falls
out with God, and justifies it when he hath done. Surely such fits as
these proceeded from great inward combustion. Would wise, sober,
holy men have said or done such things if they had not been transported
beyond themselves? and though in such cases the fits are soon
over, yet we observe that some are apt to fall into such fits often, and
are so easily irritated, that, like the epileptic person possessed by the
devil, upon every occasion, they are by him ‘cast into the fire or into
the water,’ [Mat. xvii. 15,] and by the frequent return of their distemper
are never at rest.</p>

<p>As to others, whose tempers are more apt to retain a troublesome
impression, it is very obvious that their discomposures have as much
in length and breadth as the other had in height. You may view
Haman tormented under his secret discontent, which his pride and
envy formed in him, for the want of Mordecai’s obeisance. The king’s
favour, a great estate, high honour, and what else a man could wish
to make him content, are all swallowed up in this gulf, and become
nothing to him. You see Amnon, vexed and sick for his sister Tamar,
waxing lean from day to day. You see Ahab, though a king, who
had enough to satisfy his mind, in the same condition for Naboth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
vineyard. If you say these were wicked men, who rid their lusts
without a bridle, and used the spur; look then upon better men and
you will see too much. Rachel so grieves and mourns for want of
children, that she professeth her life inconsistent with her disappointment:
‘Give me children, else I die,’ [Gen. xxx. 1.] Hannah upon
the same occasion weeps and eats not, and prays in the bitterness of
her soul, and the abundance of her complaint and grief. Jeremiah,
being pressed with discouragements from the contradiction of evil men,
calls himself ‘a man of strife and contention to the whole earth,’ Jer.
xv. 10; his sorrows thence arising, had so imbittered his life, that he
puts ‘a woe’ upon his birth: ‘Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast
born me a man of strife.’ Paul had a noble courage under manifold
afflictions; he could glory in the cross and rejoice in persecutions;
nevertheless the greatness of his work, the froward perverseness and
unsteadiness of professors, which put him under fears, jealousies, and
new travail, the miseries of Christians, and the care he had for the
concerns of the gospel—2 Cor. xi. 2; Gal. vi. 19—which was a constant
load upon his mind, his heart,—like old Eli’s, trembling still for
the ark of God, made him complain as one worn out by the troubles
of his heart: 2 Cor. xi. 27, ‘In weariness and painfulness, in watchings
often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
Besides those things that are without, that which cometh upon
me daily, the care of all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not
weak?’ &amp;c. For the Jews he had great heaviness and continual sorrow
in his heart; and for the Gentiles he had perpetual fears, Rom.
ix. 2. Now though he had a great share of divine comforts intermixed,
and a more than ordinary assistance of the Spirit to keep him
from sinful discomposure of spirit, at least to such a height as it
ordinarily prevails upon others, yet was he very sensible of his burden,
and doubtless the devil laboured to improve these occasions to weary
out his strength. For by these and such like things he frequently
vexeth the righteous souls of the faithful ministers of the gospel from
day to day; so that their hearts have no rest, and their hands grow
often feeble, and they cry out, Oh the burden! oh the care! being
ready to say, as Jeremiah, chap. xx. 7, ‘O Lord, thou hast deceived me,
and I was deceived: I am a derision daily, every one mocketh me.’
Thus say they, Did we ever think to meet with such disappointments,
such griefs, from the wilfulness, pride, weakness, ignorance, pettishness,
inconstancy, negligence, and scandals of friends? and such
hatred, contradictions, scorns, and injuries from enemies? Were we
free, what calling would we not rather choose? what place would
we not rather go to, where we might spend the remainder of our days
in some rest and ease? Were it not better to work with our hands
for a morsel of bread? for so might our sleep be sweet to us at night,
and we should not see these sorrows. At this rate are good men
sometime disturbed, and the anguish of their spirit makes their life a
burden.</p>

<p>[2.] Yet is not this all the disturbance that the devil works upon
our hearts by these things, though these are bad enough, but they
have a tendency <i>to further trouble</i>. Discomposures of spirit, if they
continue long, turn at last into troubles of conscience. Though there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
is no affinity betwixt simple discomposure of soul and troubles of
conscience in their own nature—the objects of the former being things
external, no way relating to the soul’s interest in God and salvation,
which are the objects of the latter—yet the effects produced by the
prevalency of these disturbances are a fit stock for the engrafting of
doubts and questionings about our spiritual condition. As Saul’s
father first troubled himself for the loss of his asses, and sent his son
to seek them; but when he stayed long, he forgot his trouble, and
took up a new grief for his son, whom he feared he had lost in pursuit
of the asses; so is it sometime with men, who, after they have long
vexed themselves for injuries or afflictions, &amp;c., upon a serious consideration
of the working and power of these passions, leave their
former pursuit, and begin to bethink themselves in what a condition
their souls are, that abound with so much murmuring, rage, pride, or
impatience, and then the scene is altered, and they begin to fear they
have lost their souls, and are now perplexed about their spiritual
estate. To make this plain I will give some instances, and then
add some reasons, which will evidence that it is so, and also how it
comes to be so.</p>

<p>For instances, though I might produce a sufficient number to this
purpose from those that have written of melancholy, yet I shall only
insist upon two or three from Scripture.</p>

<p>Hezekiah, when God smote him with sickness, at first was discomposed
upon the apprehension of death, that he should so soon be
deprived of the ‘residue of his years, and behold man no more with
the inhabitants of the world,’ as he himself expresseth it, Isa. xxxviii.
10; afterward his trouble grew greater, ‘He chattered as a crane or
swallow, and mourned as a dove;’ he was in ‘great bitterness,’ ver.
17; and sadly oppressed therewith, ver. 14. That which thus distressed
him was not simply the fear of death. We cannot imagine so
pious a person would so very much disquiet himself upon that single
account; but by the expressions which he let fall in his complainings,
we may understand that some such thoughts as these did shake him:
that he apprehended God was angry with him, that the present stroke
signified so much to him, all circumstances considered—for he was yet
in his strength, and Jerusalem in great distress, being at that time
besieged by Sennacherib’s army,<a id="FNanchor_325_325" href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> and for him to be doomed to death
by a sudden message at such a time, seemed to carry much in it—and
that surely there was great provocation on his part; and it seems,
upon search, he charged himself so deeply with his sinfulness, that
his apprehensions were no less than that, if God should restore him,
yet in the sense of his vileness he should never be able to look up;
‘I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul,’ ver. 15;
which expression implies a supposition of his recovery, and a deep
sense of iniquity, and accordingly when he was recovered, he takes
notice chiefly of God’s love to his soul and the pardon of his sin, which
evidently discover where the trouble pinched him: ‘Thou hast in love
to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption, for thou hast cast
all my sins behind thy back,’ ver. 17.</p>

<p>Job’s troubles were very great, and his case extraordinary. Satan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
had maliciously stripped him of all outward comforts; this he bore
with admirable patience: Job i. 21, ‘Naked came I out of my mother’s
womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord
hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.’ The devil, seeing
now himself defeated, obtains a new commission, wherein Job is wholly
put into his hand—life only excepted, chap. ii. 9. He sets upon him
again, and in his new encounter labours to bring upon him spiritual
distresses, and accordingly improves his losses and sufferings to that
end, as appears by his endeavours and the success; for as he tempted
him by his wife to a desperate disregard of God that had so afflicted
him, ‘Curse God and die,’ so he tempted him also by his friends to
question the state of his soul and his integrity, and all from the consideration
of his outward miseries. To that purpose are all their
discourses. Eliphaz, chap. iv. 5-7, from his sufferings and his
carriage under them, takes occasion to jeer his former piety, as being
no other than feigned, ‘It is come upon thee, and thou faintest: is
not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy
ways?—that is, Is all thy religion come to this? and also concludes
him to be wicked, ‘Who ever perished, being innocent? and where
were the righteous cut off?’ Bildad, chap. viii. 6, 13, chargeth him
with hypocrisy upon the same ground, and while he makes his defence,
Zophar plainly gives him the lie, chap. xi. 3; and at this rate they
go their round; and all this while Satan, whose design it was to afflict
his conscience with the sense of divine wrath, secretly strikes in with
these accusations, insomuch that though Job stoutly defended his
integrity, yet he was wounded with inward distresses, and concluded
that these dealings of God against him were no less than God’s severe
observance of his iniquity; as is plain from his bemoaning himself in
chap. x. 2, ‘I will say unto God, Do not condemn me: shew me
wherefore thou contendest with me;’ ver. 16, 17, ‘Thou huntest me
as a fierce lion, thou renewest thy witnesses against me,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>David was a man that was often exercised with sickness and troubles
from enemies, and in all the instances almost that we meet with in
the psalms of these his afflictions, we may observe the outward occasions
of trouble brought him under the suspicion of God’s wrath and his
iniquity; so that he was seldom sick, or persecuted, but this called on
the disquiet of conscience, and brought his sin to remembrance; as
Ps. vi., which was made on the occasion of his sickness, as appears
from ver. 5, wherein he expresseth the vexation of his soul under the
apprehension of God’s anger; all his other griefs running into this
channel, as little brooks, losing themselves in a great river, change
their name and nature. He that was at first only concerned for his
sickness, is now wholly concerned with sorrow and smart under the
fear and hazard of his soul’s condition; the like we may see in Ps.
xxxviii. and many places more.</p>

<p>Having made good the assertion that discomposures of soul upon
outward occasions, by long continuance and Satan’s management, do
often run up to spiritual distress of conscience, I shall next, for
further confirmation and illustration, shew how it comes to be so.</p>

<p>(1.) Discomposures of spirit <i>do obstruct, and at last extinguish the
inward comforts of the soul</i>; so that if we suppose the discomposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
person at first, before he be thus disordered, to have had a good measure
of spiritual joy in God’s favour, and delight in his ways, yet the disturbances,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>Divert his thoughts from feeding upon these comforts, or from
the enjoyment of himself in them.</i> The soul cannot naturally be highly
intent upon two different things at once, but whatsoever doth strongly
engage the thoughts and affections, that carries the whole stream with
it, be it good or bad, and other things give way at present. When
the heart is vehemently moved on outward considerations, it lays by
the thoughts of its sweetness which it hath had in the enjoyment of
God; they are so contrary and inconsistent, that either our comforts
will chase out of our thoughts our discomposures, or our discomposures
will chase away our comforts. I believe the comforts of Elias, when
he lay down under his grief, and desired to die; and of Jeremiah,
when he cried out of violence, run very low in those fits of discontent,
and their spirits were far from an actual rejoicing in God. But this is
not the worst; we may not so easily imagine that upon the going away
of the fit, the wonted comforts return to their former course. For,</p>

<p>[2.] The mind being distracted with its burden, is <i>left impotent
and unable to return to its former exercise</i>. The warmth which the
heart had, being smothered and suspended in its exercise, is not so
quickly revived, and the thoughts which were busied with disturbance,
like the distempered humours of the body, are not reduced suddenly
to that evenness of composure as may make them fit for their old
employment. And,</p>

<p>[3.] If God should <i>offer the influences of joyful support, a discomposed
spirit is not in a capacity to receive them</i>, no more than it can
receive those counsels that by any careful hand are interposed for its
relief and settlement. Comforts are not heard in the midst of noise
and clamour. The calmness of the soul’s faculties are presupposed as
a necessary qualification towards its reception of a message of peace.
Phinehas his wife being overcome of grief for the ark’s captivity and
her husband’s death, could not be affected with the joyful news of a
son, [1 Sam. iv. 19, <i>seq.</i>] But,</p>

<p>[4.] Sinful discomposures <i>hinder these gracious and comfortable
offers; if we could possibly, which we cannot ordinarily, receive them,
yet we cannot expect that God will give them</i>. The Spirit of consolation
loves to take up his lodging in a ‘meek and quiet spirit,’ and
nothing more grieves him than bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, and
malice, which made the apostle, Eph. iv. 30, 31, subjoin his direction
of ‘putting these away’ from us, with his advice of ‘not grieving
the Spirit by which we are sealed unto the day of redemption.’ And
then,</p>

<p>[5.] <i>The former stock of comfort, which persons distempered with
discomposures might be supposed to have, will soon be wasted</i>, for our
comforts are not like the oil in the cruse, or meal in the barrel, which
had, as it were, their spring in themselves. We are comforted and
supported by daily communication of divine aid, so that if the spring-head
be stopped, the stream will quickly grow dry. It is evident then
that inward consolations in God will not ripen under these shadows,
nor grow under these continual droppings, seeing a discomposed spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
is not capable to receive more, nor able to keep what comfort it had
at first. We may easily see how it comes to pass that these disturbances
may in time bring on spiritual troubles; for if our comforts be
once lost, trouble of conscience easily follows. Where there is nothing
to fortify the heart, the poison of malicious suggestions will unavoidably
prevail.</p>

<p>(2.) Discomposures of soul afford the devil <i>fit matter to work upon</i>.
They furnish him with strong objections against sincerity of holiness,
by which the peace of conscience, being strongly assaulted, is at last
overthrown. The usual weapons by which Satan fights against the
assurance of God’s children, are the guilt of sins committed and the
neglect of duty; and the disturbed soul affords enough of both these
to make a charge against itself: for,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>Where there is much discomposure there is much sin.</i> If in
the multitude of words there wants not iniquity, then much more in
the multitude of unruly thoughts. A disturbed spirit is like troubled
water; all the mud that lay at the bottom is raised up and mixeth
itself with the thoughts. If any injury or loss do trouble the mind,
all the thoughts are tinctured with anger, pride, impatience, or whatsoever
root of bitterness was in the heart before. We view them not
singly as the issues of wise providence, but ordinarily we consider
them as done by such instruments, and against ourselves, as malicious,
spiteful, causeless, ungrateful wrongs; and then we give too great a
liberty to ourselves to rage, to meditate revenge, to threaten, to
reproach, and what not. And if our disposition have not so strong a
natural inclination to these distempers, yet the thoughts by discomposure
are quickly leavened. It is the comparison used by the apostle,
1 Cor. v. 8, to express the power of malice, which is a usual attendant
in this service, to infect all the imaginations with a sharpness, which
makes them swell into exorbitancy and excess; hence proceed revilings,
quarrellings, &amp;c. When the tongue is thus fermented, it is ‘a
fire, a world of iniquity,’ producing more sins than can be reckoned,
‘it defileth the whole body,’ engaging all the faculties in heady pursuit,
James iii. 6.</p>

<p>[2.] <i>Discomposures obstruct duties.</i> This is the inconvenience which
the apostle, 1 Pet. iii. 7, tells us doth arise from disturbances among
relations. If the wife or husband do not carry well, so that discontents
or differences arise, their prayers are hindered. Duties then are
obstructed, 1. <i>In the act</i>. When the heart is out of frame, prayer
is out of season, and there is an averseness to it; partly because all
good things are, in such confusions, burdensome to the humour that
then prevails, which eats out all desire and delight to spiritual things;
and partly because they dare not come into God’s presence, conscious
of their own guilt, and awe of God hindering such approaches. 2.
They obstruct the <i>right manner of performance</i>, straitening the heart
and contracting the spirit, that if anything be attempted it is poorly
and weakly performed, 3. And also <i>the success of duty</i> is obstructed
by discomposure. God will not accept such services, and therefore
Christ adviseth to ‘leave the gift before the altar,’ though ready for
offering, where the spirit is overcharged with offences or angry
thoughts, and ‘first to go and be reconciled to our brother,’ and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
to ‘come and offer the gift,’ it being lost labour to do it before, [Mat.
v. 24.] From these sins of omission and commission Satan can, and
often doth, frame a dreadful charge against those that are thus concerned,
endeavouring to prove by these evidences that they are yet,
notwithstanding pretence of conversion, in ‘the gall of bitterness and
bond of iniquity,’ [Acts viii. 23,] whereby the peace of conscience is
much shaken; and the more because also,</p>

<p>[3.] These discomposures of soul give Satan <i>a fit season for the
management of his accusation</i>. Strong accusations do often effect
nothing when the season is unsuitable. Many a time he hath as
much to say against the comforts of men, when yet they shake all off,
as Paul did the viper off his hand, and feel no harm, [Acts xxviii. 3.]
But that which prepares the conscience to receive the indictment is a
particular disposition which it is wrought into by suspicious credulity
and fearfulness. These make the heart, as wax to the seal, ready to
take any impression that Satan will stamp upon it. Now, by long
disturbances, he works the heart into this mould very often, and upon
a double account he gains himself a fit opportunity to charge home
his exceptions. 1. In that he sets upon the conscience with his
accusations after the heart hath been long molested and confused
with its other troubles; for then the heart is weakened, and unable to
make resistance as at other times. An assault with a fresh party
after a long conflict disorders its forces, and puts all to flight. 2. In
that long and great discomposures of mind bring on a distemper of
melancholy; for it is notoriously known by common experience that
those acid humours producing this distemper, which have their rise
from the blood, may be occasioned by their violent passions of mind,
the animal spirits becoming inordinate by long discomposures of sadness,
envy, terror, and fretful cares, and the motion of the blood
being retarded, it by degrees departs from its temperament, and is
infected with an acidity, so that persons no way inclined naturally to
melancholy may yet become so by the disquiets of their troubled
mind.</p>

<p>Both these ways, but chiefly melancholy, the devil hath his advantage
for disturbing the conscience. Melancholy most naturally
inclines men to be solicitous for their souls’ welfare; but withal disposeth
them so strongly to suspect the worst—for it is a credulous,
suspicious humour in things hurtful—and afflicts so heavily with sadness
for what it doth respect, that when Satan lays before men of that
humour their miscarriages under their discontents, their impatience,
unthankfulness, anger, rash thoughts, and speeches against God or
men, &amp;c., withal suggesting that such a heart cannot be right with
God, after serious thoughts upon Satan’s frequently repeated charge,
they cry out, Guilty, guilty; and then begins a new trouble for their
unregenerate estate, and their supposed lost souls.</p>

<p>[4.] In this case usually Satan hath greater <i>liberty to accuse, and
by his accusations to molest the conscience</i>, in that men of discomposed
spirits, by the manifold evils arising thence, provoke God to desert
them, and to leave them in Satan’s hand to be brought into an hour
of temptation. Satan’s commission is occasioned by our provocations,
and the temptations arising from such a commission are usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
dreadful. They are solemn temptations, and called so after a singular
manner; for of these I take those scriptures to be meant, ‘Watch
and pray, that ye enter not into temptation, Mat. xxvi. 41; ‘And
lead us not into temptation,’ Mat. vi. 13. Such temptations are not
common temptations, and are of unknown force and hazard to the
soul, which way soever they are designed, either for sin or terror.
For several things do concur in a solemn temptation. As, 1. Satan
doth in a special manner challenge a man to the combat, or rather
he challenges God to give him such a man to fight with him, as he
did concerning Job. This Christ tells us of, Luke xxii. 31, ‘Simon,
Satan hath desired to have you.’ The word signifies a challenging
or daring—ἐξαιτεῖσθαι; and it seems the devil is oft daring God to
give us into his hand, when we little know of it. 2. There is also a
special suitableness of occasion and snare to the temper and state of
men. Thus he took Peter at an advantage in the high priest’s hall;
and in the case we now speak of he takes advantage of men’s provocations
and melancholy. 3. There is always a violent prosecution,
which our Saviour expresseth under the comparison of sifting, which
is a restless agitation of the corn, bringing that which was at the
bottom to the top, and shuffling the top to the bottom, so that the
chaff or dirt is always uppermost. 4. And to all this there is divine
permission, Satan let loose, and we left to our ordinary strength, as is
implied in that expression, ‘He hath desired to have you that he
might sift you.’ Now then, if the devil have such ground to give
God a challenge concerning such men, and if God do, as he justly
may, leave such men, whose bitterness of spirit hath been as ‘a
smoke in his nostrils all the day,’ [Isa. lxv. 5,] in Satan’s hand, he
will so shake them that their consciences shall have no rest. And
this he can yet the more easily effect, because,</p>

<p>[5.] Discomposures of spirit have a particular tendency <i>to incline
our thoughts to severity and harshness</i>, so that those who have had
long and great disturbances upon any outward occasions—of loss,
affliction, or disappointment, &amp;c.—do naturally think, after a solemn
review of such troubles, harshly of God and of themselves. They are
ready to conclude that God is surely angry with them in that he doth
afflict them, or that they have unsanctified hearts in that their
thoughts are so fretful and unruly upon every inconsiderable petty
occasion. It is so ordinary for men under the weight of their trouble,
or under the sense of their sin, to be sadly apprehensive of God’s
wrath and their soul’s hazard, that it were needless to offer instances:
let David’s case be instead of all. That his troubles begot such
imaginations frequently, may be seen throughout the book of the
Psalms. We never read his complaints against persecuting enemies,
or for other afflictions, but still his heart is afraid that God is calling
sin to remembrance. In Ps. xxxviii. he is under great distress, and
tells how low his thoughts were: he was ‘troubled,’ greatly ‘bowed
down;’ he ‘went mourning all the day long;’ he expresseth his
thoughts to have been that ‘God had forsaken him,’ ver. 21: and his
hopes, though they afterward revived, were almost gone; he cries out
of his sins as having ‘gone over his head,’ and become ‘a burden too
heavy for him,’ ver. 4, and therefore sets himself to confess them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
ver. 18. He trembles at God’s anger, and feels the ‘arrows of God
sticking fast in him,’ ver. 2. But what occasioned all this? The
psalm informs us, God had visited him with sickness, ver. 7.
Besides that—for one trouble seldom comes alone—his friends were
perfidious, ver. 11; his enemies also were busy laying snares for his
life, ver. 12. Now his thoughts were to this purpose, that surely he
had some way or other greatly provoked God by his sins, and therefore
he fears wrath in every rebuke, and displeasure in every chastisement,
ver. 1. The like you may see in Ps. cii., where the prophet
upon the occasion of sickness, ver. 3, 23, and the reproach of enemies,
ver. 8, is under great trouble, and ready to fail except speedy relief
prevent, ver. 2: the reason whereof was this, that he concluded these
troubles were evident tokens of God’s indignation and wrath; ‘because
of thine indignation and thy wrath,’ ver. 10. From these five particulars
we may be satisfied that it cannot be otherwise, and also how
it comes to be so, that sometime trouble of conscience is brought on
by other discomposing troubles of the mind. For if these take away
the comforts which supported the soul, and afford also arguments to
the devil to prove a wicked heart, and withal ‘a fit season’ to urge
them to a deep impression, God in the meantime standing ‘at a distance,’
and the thoughts naturally inclined to conclude God’s wrath
from these troubles, how impossible is it that Satan should miss of
disquieting the conscience by his strong, vehement suggestions of
wickedness and desertion!</p>

<p>In our inquiries after Satan’s success in working these discomposures
of mind, we have discovered, 1. That the disturbances thence
arising are great; 2. That they have a tendency to trouble of conscience.
There is but one particular more to be spoken of, relating to
his success in this design, and that is,</p>

<p>(3.) These disturbances are <i>much in Satan’s power</i>. Ordinarily he
can do it at pleasure, except when God restrains him from applying
fit occasions, or when, notwithstanding these occasions, he extraordinarily
suspends the effect, which he frequently doth when men
are enraged under suffering upon the account of the gospel and
conscience; for then, though they be bound up under affliction
and iron, yet the ‘iron enters not into the soul;’ though they are
troubled, they are not distressed. These extraordinaries excepted,
he can as easily discompose the spirits of men as he can by temptation
draw them into other sins; which may be evidenced by these
considerations:</p>

<p>[1.] We may observe that those <i>whose passionate tempers do usually
transport them into greater vehemencies, are never out of trouble</i>.
Their fits frequently return, they are never out of the fire, and this
is because Satan is still provided of occasions suitable to their inclinations.</p>

<p>[2.] Though God, out of his common bounty to mankind, hath
allowed him a comfortable being in the world, yet we find that generally
the sons of men, under their various occupations and studies, are
wearied out <i>with vexations of spirit</i>. This Solomon, in Ecclesiastes,
discovers at large in various employments of men, not exempting the
pursuit of wisdom and knowledge: chap. i. 18, ‘In much wisdom is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow:’
nor pleasures nor riches, for by all these he shews that a man is obnoxious
to disquiets; so that the general account of man’s life is but
this: chap. ii. 23, ‘All his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea,
his heart taketh not rest in the night.’ That it is so, is testified by
common experience past denial; but how it comes to be so, is the
inquiry. It is either from God, or from Satan working by occasions
upon our tempers. That it is not from God, is evident; for though
sorrow be a part of that curse which man was justly doomed unto, yet
hath he appointed ways and means by which it might be so mitigated
that it might be tolerable without discomposure of spirit; and therefore
Solomon, designing in his Ecclesiastes to set forth the chief good,
shews that felicity consists not in the common abuse of outward things,
because that brings only vexation, but in the fear of God leading to
future happiness, and in the meantime in a thankful, comfortable use
of things present without anxiety of mind. Hence doth he fix his
conclusion, as the result of his experience, and often repeats it: ‘There
is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and
that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour,’ chap. ii. 24,
iii. 12, 13, and v. 18, 19. Not that Solomon plays the epicure, giving
advice ‘to eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,’ nor that he speaks deridingly
to those that seek their felicity in this life, as if he should say,
‘If ye do terminate your desires upon a terrene felicity, there is nothing
better than to eat and drink,’ &amp;c. But he gives a serious positive
advice of enjoying the things of this life with cheerfulness, which
he affirms proceeds from the sole bounty of God as his singular gift:
‘It is the gift of God,’ chap. iii. 13; ‘it is our portion’—that is, our
allowance, chap. v. 19, for these two expressions, ‘our portion,’ and
‘God’s gift,’ they are of the same signification with Solomon here;
and when a man hath power to enjoy this allowance in comfort, it is
God that ‘answereth him in the joy of his heart,’ ver. 20. It is plain,
then, that God ‘sows good seed in his field;’ the springing up, therefore,
of these tares of vexation, which so generally afflict the sons of
men, must be ascribed to this, ‘the enemy hath done it,’ [Mat. xiii. 28.]</p>

<p>[3.] It is also a considerable ground of suspicion that Satan can do
much in discomposures of spirit, in that sometimes those whose tempers
are <i>most cool and calm, and whose singular dependence upon, and
communion with God, must needs more strengthen them against these
passionate vexations, are notwithstanding precipitated into violent
commotions</i>. Moses was naturally meek above the common disposition
of men, and his very business was converse with God, whose presence
kept his heart under a blessed awe; yet, upon the people’s murmuring,
he was so transported with sullenness and unbelief, at the
waters of Meribah, Num. xx. 10-12, that ‘it went ill with him;’
which David thus expresseth, Ps. cvi. 33, ‘They provoked his spirit,
so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.’ Who can suppose less in
this matter than that Satan, having him at advantage, hurried him
to this rashness—specially seeing such vehemencies were not usual
with Moses, and that his natural temper led him to the contrary?
This hath some affinity with the next consideration, which is,</p>

<p>[4.] That when <i>men most foresee the occasions of their trouble, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
do most fear the trouble that might thence arise, and most firmly design
to keep their hearts quiet, yet are they oft forced, against all care and
resolution, upon extravagant heats</i>. David resolved and strenuously
endeavoured to possess his soul in serenity and patience;—for what
could be more than that solemn engagement? Ps. xxxix. 1, ‘I said
I will look to my ways;’ and what endeavours could be more severe
than to keep himself ‘as with bit and bridle’? what care could be
more hopeful to succeed than to be ‘dumb with silence’?—yet for all
this he could not keep his heart calm nor restrain his tongue: ver.
3, ‘My heart waxed hot within me; while I was musing the fire
burned: then spake I with my tongue.’ Who suspects not the hand
of Satan in this?</p>

<p>[5.] It is also remarkable, that when we have <i>least reason to give
way to discomposure, when we have most cause to avoid all provocations,
yet then we have most occasions set before us</i>. When we would
most retire from the noise of the world for private devotion, when we
would most carefully prepare ourselves for a solemn ordinance, if we
be not very watchful, we shall be diverted by business, disturbed with
noises, or some special occasion of vexation shall importune us to disquiet
ourselves—when yet we shall observe, if we have not these
solemn affairs to wait upon, we shall have fewer of these occasions of
vexation to attend us. This cannot be attributed to mere contingency
of occasions, nor yet to our tempers solely; for why they should be
most apt to give us trouble when they are most engaged to calmness,
cannot well be accounted for. It is evidently, then, Satan that
maliciously directs these occasions—for they have not a malicious ingenuousness
to prepare themselves, without some other chief mover—at
such times as he knows would be most to our prejudice.</p>

<p>These general considerations amount to more than a suspicion, that
it is much in Satan’s power to give disturbances to the minds of men;
yet, for the clearer manifestation of the matter, I shall shew that he
can do much to bring about occasions of discomposure, and also to
stir up the passions of men upon these occasions.</p>

<p>1. That occasions are much in his hand, I shall easily demonstrate.
For,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, There being <i>so many occasions of vexation to a weak, crazy
mind, we may well imagine that one or other is still occurring</i>; and
while they thus offer themselves, Satan needs not be idle for want of
an opportunity.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, But if common occasions do not so exactly suit his design,
<i>he can prepare occasions</i>; for such is his foresight and contrivance,
that he can put some men—without their privity to his intentions, or
any evil design of their own—upon such actions as may, through the
strength of prejudice, misinterpretation, or evil inclination, be an
offence to others; and, in like manner, can invite those to be in
the way of these offences. I am ready to think there was a contrivance
of Satan—if we well consider all circumstances—to bring
David and the object of his lust together; while Bathsheba was
bathing, he might use his art in private motions to get David up
to the roof of his house. But more especially can the devil prepare
occasions that do depend upon the wickedness of his slaves; these are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
servants under his command, he can ‘say to one, Go, and he goes;
and to another, Come, and he comes.’ If contempt or injury, affronts
or scorns, &amp;c., be necessary for his present work against any whom he
undertakes to disturb, he can easily put his vassals upon that part of
the service; and if he have higher employment for them, he ever finds
them forward. And hence was it, that when Satan designed to
plunder Job, he could quickly perform it, because he had the Chaldeans
and Sabeans ready at a call.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, If both these should fail him, he can easily awaken in us
<i>the memory of old occasions that have been heretofore a trouble to us</i>.
These being raised out of their graves will renew old disturbances,
working afresh the same disquiets which the things themselves gave
us at first.</p>

<p>If Satan’s power were bounded here, and that he could do no more
than set before men occasions of vexation, yet we might justly, on
that single account, call him the troubler of the spirits of men; considering
that naturally the thoughts of men are restless, and their
imaginations ever rolling. If men sequester themselves from all
business, if they shut themselves up from commerce with men, turn
Eremites—as Jerome did—on purpose to avoid disquiet, yet their
thoughts would hurry them from place to place, sometimes to the
court, sometimes to the market, sometimes to shows and pastimes,
sometimes to quarrellings; sometimes they view fields, buildings, and
countries; sometimes they fancy dignities, promotions, and honours;
they are ever working upon one object or other, real or supposed, and
according to the object such will the affections be, high or low, joyful
or sorrowful; so that if the utmost of what Satan could do were
no more than to provide occasions, discomposures would follow
naturally. The evil dispositions of men would thereby be set a-working,
though Satan stood by as an idle spectator. The serpent—in our
breasts, as Solomon tells us, Eccles. x. 11—would ‘bite without
enchantment,’ that is, except it were charmed. But Satan can do
more than tempt objectively, when he hath provided the fuel he can
also bring fire. For,</p>

<p>2. <i>He can also set our passions on work, and incense them to greater
fury than otherwise they would arrive at.</i> We see persons that are
distempered with passion may be whetted up to a higher pitch of
rage by any officious flatterer, that will indulge the humour and
aggravate the provocation. Much more then can Satan do it by
whispering such things to our minds as he knows will increase the
flame; and therefore is it, that where the Scripture doth caution
us against anger—as the proper product of our own corruption, calling
it our wrath, Eph. iv. 26, 27—there also it warns us against the devil,
as the incendiary, that endeavours to heighten it. And where it tells
us of the disorders of the tongue,—which, though a little member, can
of itself do great mischief, James iii. 6—there it also tells us that the
devil brings it an additional fire from hell: ‘It is set on fire of hell.’
And there are several ways by which Satan can irritate the passions.
As,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>By presenting the occasions worse than they are, or were ever
intended, unjustly aggravating all circumstances.</i> By this means he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
makes the object of the passions the more displeasing and hateful.
This must of necessity provoke to a higher degree.</p>

<p>[2.] <i>He can in a natural way move, as it were, the wheels, and set
the passions a-going, if they were of themselves more dull and sluggish</i>,
for he hath a nearer access to our passions than every one is aware of.
I will make it evident thus: our passions in their workings do depend
upon the fluctuations, excursions, and recursions of the blood and
animal spirits, as naturalists do determine.<a id="FNanchor_326_326" href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> Now that Satan can
make his approaches to the blood, spirits, and humours, and can make
alterations upon them, cannot be denied by those that consider what
the Scripture speaks in Job’s case, and in the cases of those that were
by possession of the devil made dumb, deaf, or epileptic; for if he
could afflict Job with grievous boils, chap. ii. 7, it is plain he disordered
and vitiated his blood and humours, which made them apt to produce
such boils or ulcers; and if he could produce an epilepsy, it is evident
that he could infect the <i>lympha</i> with such a sharpness as by vellicating
the nerves might cause a convulsion; and these were much more than
the disorderly motions of blood, spirits, or humours, which raise the
passions of men. If any object to this, that then, considering Satan’s
malicious diligence, we must expect the passions of men would never
be at rest; it is answered, that this power of Satan is not unlimited,
but oft God prohibits him such approaches, and without his leave he
can do nothing; and also grace in God’s children, working calmness,
submission, and patience, doth balance Satan’s contrary endeavour.
For as hurtful and vexatious occasions, being represented by the sense
to the imagination, are apt to move the blood and spirits; so, on the
contrary, the ballast of patience and other graces doth so settle the
mind, that the blood and spirits are kept steady in their usual course.</p>

<p>[3.] <i>When the passions are up, Satan can by his suggestions make
them more heady and violent.</i> He can suggest to the mind motives
and arguments to forward it, and can stir up our natural corruption,
with all its powers, to strike in with the opportunity. Thus he not
only kindles the fire, but blows the flame.</p>

<p>[4.] <i>And he can further fix the mind upon these thoughts, and keep
them still upon the hearts of men.</i> And then they eat in the deeper,
and like poison diffuse their malignity the further. We see that
men, who are at first but in an ordinary fret, if they continue to meditate
upon their provocation, they increase their vexation; and if they
give themselves to vent their passions by their tongues, though they
begin in some moderation, yet as motion causeth heat, so their own
words whet their rage, according to Eccles. x. 13, ‘The beginning of
the words of his mouth is foolishness, but the latter end of his talk is
mischievous madness.’ The same advantage hath Satan against men
by holding down their thoughts to these occasions of discomposure.</p>

<p>If occasions be so much in Satan’s power, and he have also so great
a hand over men’s passions, it is too evident that he can do very
much to discompose the spirits of men that are naturally obnoxious
to these troubles, except God restrain him, and grace oppose him.
Thus have I spoken my thoughts of the first sort of troubles, by which
Satan doth undermine the peace of men’s hearts.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VII_2">CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of the second way to hinder peace.—Affrightments, the general nature
and burden of them, in several particulars.—What are the ways by
which he affrights: </i>1. <i>Atheistical injections. Observations of his
proceeding in them; </i>2. <i>Blasphemous thoughts; </i>3. <i>Affrightful
suggestions of reprobation. Observations of his proceedings in that
course; </i>4. <i>Frightful motions to sin; </i>5. <i>Strong immediate impressions
of fear; </i>6. <i>Affrightful scrupulosity of conscience.</i></p>


<p>The next rank of troubles by which the devil doth endeavour to
molest us, I call <i>affrightments</i>. It is usual for those that speak of
temptations, to distinguish them thus: Some are, they say, enticements,
some are affrightments; but then they extend these affrightments
further than I intend, comprehending under them all those
temptations of sadness and terror, of which I am next to speak. But
by affrightments, I mean only those perplexities of spirit into which
Satan casts men, by overacting their fears, or astonishing their minds,
by injecting unusual and horrid thoughts against their consents.<a id="FNanchor_327_327" href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a>
Some there are that have thought those temptations, of which the
apostle complains, 2 Cor. xii. 7, ‘There was given me a thorn in the
flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me,’ were of this kind—that is,
horrid injections frequently repeated, as men deal their blows in fighting.
Gerson, speaking of these, tells us they sometime come from the sole
suggestion of Satan troubling the fancy, and saying, Deny God, curse
God; and then adds, such was the thorn in the flesh given to the
apostle.<a id="FNanchor_328_328" href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> But whether this was the trouble of the apostle, or some
other thing—for several things are conjectured, and nothing can be
positively proved—we are sure, from the sad experience of many, that
such troubles he doth often give; which I shall first explain in the
general, and then give a particular of these frightful injections.</p>

<p>1. To explain the nature and burden of this kind of trouble, I shall
present you with a few observations about them. As,</p>

<p>[1.] These astonishing thoughts are purely <i>injections</i>, such as <i>Satan
casts into the mind, and not what the mind of itself doth produce</i>; as
one expresseth it, they are more darting than reflecting. Not but
that our natural corruption could of itself beget blasphemous or atheistical
thoughts; but when they have their rise from ourselves solely,
they do not so startle us. Having some share at least of our consent
going along with them, they appear not so strange. But in this case
in hand, Satan is the agent, and men are the sufferers, their understandings
and souls being busied all the while to repel them, with the
utmost of their reluctances. And to those that do thus strive against
them, making resistance with all their strength, with tears and prayers,
they are only their afflictions, but not their sins. For the thoughts
are not polluted by the simple apprehension of a sinful object, no more
than the eye is defiled by beholding loathsome and filthy things; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
then should the mind of Christ have been defiled, when Satan propounded
himself blasphemously as the object of his worship; his
mind as truly apprehended the meaning of that saying, ‘fall down
and worship me,’ as ours can do, when he casts such a thing immediately
into our thoughts. Which is a consideration to be observed
diligently by those that meet with such sad exercise. If they do
truly apprehend that they are but their sufferings, and that God will
not charge the sin upon them, they will more easily bear and overcome
the trouble.</p>

<p>These injections are commonly impetuous and sudden, frequently
compared to lightning; and this is usually made a note of distinction
betwixt wicked, blasphemous thoughts rising from our natural corruption,
and darted in by Satan; the former being more leisurely,
orderly, and moderate, according to the usual course of the procedure
of human thoughts, the latter usually accompanied with a hasty
violence, subtly and incoherently shooting into our understandings,
as lightning into a house; so that all the strength we have can neither
prevent them nor expel them, nor so much as mitigate the violence of
them.</p>

<p>[3.] They are also for the most part <i>incessant and constant troublers
where they once begin</i>. Though Satan hath variety, in regard of the
matter of these amazing injections—for sometimes he affrights one
man with blasphemous thoughts, another with atheistical thoughts, a
third with grievous, unusual temptations to sin, as murder, &amp;c.—yet
usually he fixeth his foot upon what he first undertakes. And as
cunning huntsmen do not change their game that they first rouse, that
they may sooner speed in catching the prey; so what frightful thought
Satan begins the trouble with, that he persists in, and is withal so
vehement in his pursuit, that he gives little intermission. He makes
these unwelcome thoughts haunt them like ghosts, whithersoever they
go, whatsoever they do; he will give solemn onsets it may be twenty
or forty times in a day: and at this rate he continues, it may be for
some considerable time, so that they are not quit of the trouble for
several months, or it may be years.</p>

<p>[4.] The matter of these affrightments are things <i>most contrary to
the impressions of nature or grace, and therefore most odious and
troublesome</i>. When he is upon this design, things that are most contrary
to the belief and inclination of men are best for his purpose; as
men that intend to affright others choose the most ugly vizors, the
strangest garbs and postures, and make the most uncouth, inhuman
noises; and the more monstrous they appear, the better they succeed
in their purposes. Yet Satan doth not always choose the very worst,
for then most of the troubles of this kind would be about the same
thing; but he considers the strength of our persuasions, our establishment
in truths, the probability or improbability of an after game
with us; and accordingly sometimes refuseth to trouble us with injections,
contrary to what we are most firmly rooted in, choosing rather
that which, though contrary to our thoughts and resolves, we have not
been fixed in without a great deal of labour, and which, if there be
occasion, might most fitly be charged upon us as our own, so that,
whereas other suggestions would be slighted as apparent malice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
scarecrows, these are most afflicting, as being an assault against such
a fort which costs us much to rear, and which we are most afraid to
lose, and most liable to his accusation after a long continuance, as
being the issue of our own unsettledness.</p>

<p>[5.] The first and most obvious effects of these injections are <i>the
utmost abhorrency of the mind</i>—which presently startles at the appearance
of such odious things—<i>and the trembling of the body, sometimes
to an agony and fainting</i>. The invasion of one single injection hath
put some into such a heart-breaking affrightment, that they have not
recovered themselves in a whole day’s time. This trembling of the
body and agony of the mind are the usual consequences of anything
that is surprising, strange, and fearful; and therefore is trembling of
the body made by divines a mark to discover that these hideous, blasphemous
thoughts are cast in by Satan, and have not their rise from
our own hearts; for the horror of the mind is usually so great, when
it is spoken to in this language, that it cannot bear up under its
astonishment and trouble. Yea, those very men that are otherwise
profane, and can with boldness commit great iniquities, cannot but
shake, and inwardly conceive an unspeakable hatred at these monstrous
suggestions.<a id="FNanchor_329_329" href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<p>[6.] <i>These affrightments are more common than men are usually
aware of.</i> They are by some thought to be rare and extraordinary;
but this mistake ariseth from the concealment of these kind of
troubles. Those that are thus afflicted are often ashamed to speak to
others what they find in their own hearts; but if all would be so
ingenuous as to declare openly what fearful imaginations are obtruded
upon them, it would appear that Satan very frequently endeavours to
trouble men this way.</p>

<p>[7.] <i>These are very grievous burdens, and hard to be borne upon
many accounts.</i></p>

<p><i>First</i>, Who can well express <i>the inward torture and molestation of
the mind</i>, when it is forced against its own natural bent and inclination
to harbour such monsters within itself! How would nature
reluct and abominate the drinking down of noisome puddled water,
or the swallowing of toads and serpents! And hence was it that
persecutors in their devilish contrivances invented such kind of tortures.
And what less doth the devil do when he forceth blasphemies
upon their thoughts, and commits a rape by a malicious violence
upon their imaginations? David, under these temptations, Ps.
lxxiii. 21, cries out, ‘Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked
in my reins:’ and it cannot be otherwise, for the reason already
mentioned. Nature abhors to be forced to what is most contrary
to itself, and so doth grace. Now the things by which Satan
works these affrightments are contrary to nature or grace, or both
together; and as they will strive to the utmost of their ability to
cast out what is so opposite to them, so must the devil to the utmost
of his ability, if he would carry his design, strengthen himself in
his force, and from hence, as when fire and water are committed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>gether,
ariseth a most troublesome conflict; and indeed if there were
a compliance of our consent, there would be no affrightment; neither
can this kind of temptation be managed except there be the utmost
dissent of the mind. If any think there is no great ground for these
temptations, because some of the particulars by which he is said to
affright men are natural to us, as, for instance, atheistical thoughts,
which are by some called the master-vein of our original corruption,
and by others said to be in the heart of every man naturally, and then
consequently not so troublesome as is imagined, &amp;c.; I answer, that
when divines call these or blasphemous thoughts natural, they do not
mean that they are natural impressions engraven on us by creation,—for
they assert the contrary; that it is a natural and unextinguishable
impression upon every man that there is a God, &amp;c., and usually
give in this for proof, that the greatest atheists in fear and extremity
will manifest a secret belief of a deity, by calling out, O God, &amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_330_330" href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>
or by some other posture, as Caligula by hiding himself when it
thundered,—but they mean only that our natural corruption may produce
these thoughts, and that they are the natural issues thereof; and
therefore Perkins, in answer to a question of this nature, tells us that
these two thoughts, ‘there is a God,’ and ‘there is no God,’ may be,
and are both, in the same heart.<a id="FNanchor_331_331" href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> Now as this will give us the reason
why Satan doth make choice of these thoughts to trouble us
withal, which may also rise from ourselves—which I have hinted
before, and shall presently again touch upon—so it tells us still that
whether these thoughts arise from our own corruption or from Satan,
our natural impressions are strong against them, and withal that they
cannot be so affrightful but when Satan doth manage them, and when
the contrary impressions of nature are awakened to give strong resistance,
and then that struggling must be as the tearing of our bowels,
and still the worse in that we are incessantly pursued, Satan still casting
back with unwearied labour the same thoughts as they are repulsed
and rejected, as soldiers that besiege cities use to cast over the
walls their fired grenades.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, These are also grievous, <i>as they set the mind upon the rack,
and stretch it under laborious and doubtful inquiries after the grounds
or causes of this kind of trouble</i>, for the heart, astonished with such
cursed guests against his will, presently reflects upon God and itself
What have I done, and wherefore am I thus disquieted with monsters?
Why doth the righteous Lord suffer Satan to break open my heart, and
fill me with such fearful thoughts? But when men’s inquiries are
not so high, but detained in a consideration of the nature of the trouble
and manner of its working, without looking up to the providence of
God, then are their troubles increased.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, As these injections necessitate men, in their own defence, <i>to
oppose and every way to resist, it is an increase of the burden</i>. What
pleadings are they put to, what defiances, what endeavours to call off
the thoughts! and all to little purpose; while the trouble continues
they are forced to lie in their armour, and to be constantly in their
ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, And yet are they further troublesome <i>in the after-game that
Satan plays by these thoughts</i>. It is not all of his design to affright
men, but he usually hath another temptation to come in the rear of
this, and that is to turn these affrightments into accusations, and by
urging them long upon the hearts of men, to make them believe that
they are their own thoughts, the issues of their own natural corruption;
and after men are by continual assaults weakened, their senses
and memory dulled, their understanding confounded, &amp;c., they easily
conclude against themselves. The tempter imputes all the horrid
blasphemy to them, boldly calls them guilty of all; and because their
thoughts have dwelt long upon such a subject, and withal knowing
that corrupt nature of itself will lead men to such horrid blasphemies
or villainies—which makes it probable that it might be their own fault,
and for this reason Satan makes choice of such injections as may in
the accusation seem most likely to be true—being strongly charged as
guilty, they yield; and then begins another trouble more fearful than
the former.<a id="FNanchor_332_332" href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> Oh, what sad thoughts have they then of themselves, as
the most vile blasphemous wretches! Sometimes they think that it is
impossible that other men’s hearts should entertain such intolerable
things within them as theirs, and that none was ever so bad as they;
sometimes they think that if men knew what vile imaginations and
monstrous things are in their minds, they would in very zeal to God
and religion stone them, or at least exclude them from all commerce
with men; sometimes they think their sin to be the sin against the
Holy Ghost; sometimes they think God is engaged in point of honour
to shew upon them some remarkable judgment, and they verily look
for some fearful stroke to confound them, and live under such a frightful
expectation. These and many more to this purpose are their
thoughts, so that these temptations are every way troublesome, both in
their first and second effects.</p>

<p>Thus I have in the general expressed the nature of these affrightments.
What the particular injections are by which he studies to
affright men, I shall next declare. They are principally six:</p>

<p>1. <i>Atheistical thoughts.</i> By injecting these into the mind he doth
exceedingly affright men, and frequently for that end doth he suggest
that there is no God, and that the Scriptures are but delusive contrivances,
&amp;c. Concerning these I shall note a few things; as,</p>

<p>[1.] Though there be an observable difference betwixt <i>atheistical
injections and temptations to atheism</i>, not only in the design—Satan
chiefly intending seduction in the latter, and affrightment by the
former—but also in the manner of proceeding—(for when he designs
chiefly to tempt to atheism, he first prepares his way by debauching
the conscience with vicious or negligent living,—according to Ps. xiv.
1, that which makes men ‘say in their hearts there is no God,’ is this,
that ‘they are corrupt, and have done abominable works’—and in
this method was famous Junius tempted to atheism: but when he
chiefly intends to affright, he sets upon men that by a watchful and
strict conversation cut off from him that advantage)—yet he doth so
manage himself that he can turn his course either way, as he finds
probability of success after trial; for he presseth on upon men most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
where he finds them most to yield, so that those who were but at
first affrighted may at last be solemnly persuaded and urged to believe
the suggestion to be true if they give him any encouragement
for such a procedure.<a id="FNanchor_333_333" href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p>[2.] <i>Contemplative heads and great searchers</i> are usually most
troubled in this manner, partly because they see more difficulties than
other men, and are more sensible of human inability to resolve them,
and partly because God, who will not suffer his children to be tempted
‘above what they are able,’ doth not permit Satan to molest the
weaker sort of Christians with such dangerous assaults.</p>

<p>[3.] <i>Persons of eminent and singular holiness may be, and often are,
troubled with atheistical thoughts, and have sad conflicts about them</i>,
Satan labouring, where he cannot prevail for a positive entertainment
of atheism, at least to disquiet their minds by haunting them with his
injections, if not to weaken their assent to these fundamental truths,
in which he sometimes so prevails, that good men have publicly professed
that they have found it a harder matter to believe that there is
a God than most do imagine.</p>

<p>[4.] <i>Satan lies at the catch in this design, and usually takes men at
the advantage, suddenly setting upon them, either in the height of their
meditations and inquiries into fundamental truths</i>—for when they soar
aloft, and puzzle themselves with a difficulty, then is he at hand to
advise them to cut the knot which they cannot unloose—<i>or in the depth
of their troubles</i>—for when men cannot reconcile the daily afflictions
and sufferings which they undergo, with the love and care of God
toward his children, then it is Satan’s season to tell them that there
is no supreme disposer of things. In both these cases the devil leaps
upon them unawares, like a robber out of a thicket, who, if he do
not wound them by the dart of atheistical injection, at least he is
sure to astonish them, and to confound them with amazement. For,</p>

<p>[5.] <i>Sometimes he pursues with wonderful violence, and will dispute
with admirable subtlety, urging the inequality of providence, the seeming
contradictions of Scripture, the unsuitableness of ordinances to an
infinite wisdom and goodness, with many more arguments of like kind</i>;
and this with such unexpected acuteness and seeming demonstration,
that the most holy hearts and wisest heads shall not readily
know what to answer, but shall be forced to betake themselves to
their knees, and to beg of God that he would rebuke Satan, and uphold
them that their faith fail not. Nay, he doth not only dispute,
but by urging, and with unspeakable earnestness threaping,<a id="FNanchor_334_334" href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> the
conclusion upon men, doth almost force them to a persuasion, so that
they are almost carried off their feet whether they will or no; which
was the very case of David when the devil pursued him with atheistical
thoughts on the occasion of the prosperity of wicked men, and his
daily troubles: Ps. lxxiii. 2, ‘My feet were almost gone, my steps
had well-nigh slipped.’</p>

<p>[6.] Yet for all this he sometimes <i>lays aside his sophistical subtlety,
and betakes himself to an impudent importunity</i>; for sometimes he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
insists only on one argument, not changing that which he first took
up, nor strengthening his suggestion with variety of arguments, but
by frequent repetition of the same reason persists to urge his injected
atheism. This gives no discovery of any deep reach if he designed to
persuade—for it is scarce rational to imagine that serious men, who
by many arguments are fully persuaded there is a God, should readily
lose their hold upon the appearance of one objection—but it shews
that he purposeth only to molest. And this appears more evidently,
when he contents himself with weak and trivial arguments, which the
afflicted party can answer fully, and yet cannot for all that quit themselves
of the trouble; for instance, it is not very many years since
a serious and pious person came to me, and complained that he could
not be at rest for atheistical thoughts that perpetually haunted him;
and upon a particular inquiry into the cause and manner of his
trouble, he told me the first rise of it was from his observation, that I
had interpreted some scriptures otherwise than he had heard some
others to have done; but withal he added that he knew the reason of
his perplexity was but silly, and that which he could easily answer;
this being no just charge against the Scripture, whose sense and truth
might for all that be one, and uniform to itself, but only an implication
of human weakness appearing in the different apprehensions of
expositors; yet notwithstanding he affirmed he could not shake off
the trouble, and that his thoughts were ever urged with the same
thing for a long time together. Nay, such is his impudency in this
kind of trouble, that those who know it is the best way not to dispute
fundamentals with Satan, but with abhorrency to reject him—after the
example of Christ, with a ‘get thee behind me, Satan’—and accordingly
do with their utmost strength reject them, yet they find that he doth
not readily desist.</p>

<p>How sad is this trouble! how are pious persons affrighted to see the
face of their thoughts made abominably ugly and deformed by these
violent and unavoidable injections! It is not only wearisome to those
that know it to be solely Satan’s malice, but it often proves to be an
astonishing surprisal—like that of a traveller who, while he passeth on
his way without foresight or thought of danger, is suddenly brought
to the top of a great precipice, where, when he looks down to the vast
deep below, his head swims, his heart pants, his knees tremble, and
the very fear of the sudden danger so confounds him that he is through
excessive dread ready to fall into that which he would avoid; so are
these amazed at so great hazards before them. Satan could not by all
his art prevail with them to abandon the holy ways of God in exchange
for the pleasures of sin, and now they seem to be in danger to
lose all at once; and yet it is more affrightful by far to those that
charge, through Satan’s cunning, all this atheism upon themselves.</p>

<p>2. Another affrightful injection is that of <i>blasphemous thoughts</i>, as
that God is not just, not compassionate; that scriptures and ordinances
are but low and sorry things, &amp;c.</p>

<p>That Satan doth delight to force such thoughts upon men, is evident,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>From his nature.</i> He is a blasphemous spirit, and withal so
malicious, that whatsoever is in his cursed mind he will be ready to
vent upon all occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>[2.] <i>From his practice</i>; for where he can obtain the rule over men’s
imaginations, as in some distracted persons, and those that are distempered
with fevers, he usually makes them vomit forth oaths, cursings,
and blasphemies, and this he doth to some that, while they have
had the use of their reason, have not been observed to give their
tongue the liberty of swearing or cursed speaking.</p>

<p>[3.] <i>From his professed design in the case of Job</i>, concerning whom
he boasted to God himself that he would make him curse him to his
face, and accordingly tempted him by his wife to curse God and die.</p>

<p>[4.] <i>From the sad experience of those that have suffered under this
sad affliction</i>: for many have complained of blasphemous thoughts;
and those whom he cannot conquer he will thus trouble. Neither
need we think it strange that the devil can impress blasphemies upon
the imaginations of men against their wills, when we consider that he
could make Saul, in his fits, to behave himself like an inspired person,
and cause him to utter things beyond and unsuitable to his disposition,
after the rate and manner of those raptures which idolatrous
priests used to be transported withal. <i>Bacchatur vates.</i> [Virgil.]<a id="FNanchor_335_335" href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a>
This, in 1 Sam. xviii. 10, is called Saul’s prophesying, when the ‘evil
spirit from the Lord vexed him;’ and is the same with that which is
spoken concerning Baal’s priests: 1 Kings xviii. 29, ‘They prophesied
until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice’—that is, they
were exercised with trances and rapturous furies, in which they uttered
strange sounds and speeches. How easily, then, may Satan possess the
fancies of men with blasphemies! so that the unwilling may be
troubled with them, and those that are deprived of the benefit of reason,
may, from the power of the impression upon their imagination,
vent them with a kind of unwillingness.</p>

<p>Melancholy persons do very frequently meet with this kind of
trouble, Satan having a great power upon their imagination, and great
advantages, from the darkness of that humour, to make the fear arising
from such thoughts the more astonishing, and to delude them into an
apprehension that they are guilty of all that passeth through their
thoughts, and also to work this perplexity to more dismal effects. In
these kind of men he doth play the tyrant with such injections, abusing
them to such a height as if they were his vassals and slaves, whose
thoughts and tongues were in his and not their own keeping; and so
strongly doth he possess them with this perplexity sometimes, that all
the counsels, reasonings, or advice of others cannot in the least satisfy
or relieve them; yet, notwithstanding, I have known several under
this affliction who, when by physic the state of their bodies hath been
altered, have found themselves at ease immediately, the trouble gradually
and insensibly ceasing of itself.</p>

<p>Others there are that have great vexation from these thoughts, and
these are commonly such as by some long and grievous pain, sickness,
or other crosses, have their spirits fretted and imbittered; then is
Satan ready to suggest that God is cruel or regardless of his people;
and these thoughts are the more dreadful because fretting and murmuring
spirits have a natural tendency to think harshly of God; so
that Satan in this case doth with the more boldness obtrude these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
suggestions upon them, finding so great a forwardness toward such
imaginations, and also with greater severity he doth reflect upon
them, as being in some likelihood compliant and consenting.</p>

<p>When other persons—not so concerned as these two sorts of men
above mentioned—are assaulted with blasphemous thoughts, the fits
are less permanent, and, because they easily discover the design and
author of them, not highly affrightful, though still troublesome.</p>

<p>The burden of these injections are much like the former, very sadly
afflicting. For who can easily bear the noise of Satan while he shouts
continually into their ears odious calumnies and blasphemous indignities
against God? David could not hear wicked men blaspheme
God but it was ‘as a sword in his bones,’ exceeding painful. The
impressions of nature, that teach us to revere and honour God; the
power of education, that confirms these impressions; the persuasion
of faith, that assures us of the reality and infinite excellency of a
Godhead; and the force of love, that makes us more sensibly apprehensive
of any injury or dishonour done to him whom we love above
all;—all these do suffer by these violent incursions of Satan, and the
sufferer finds himself to be pained and tortured in these noble parts.
How grievous must it be to a child of God to have his ear chained to
these intolerable, ingrateful reproaches!—especially when we consider
that the devil will in this case utter the most dreadful blasphemies he
can devise, which will still add to the affliction—for even those men
that through habit can well bear ordinary petty oaths, will yet startle
at outrageous prodigious swearing—and therefore whatever covert and
consequential blasphemies may be to some men, these impudent, hideous
abuses of the holy and just God must needs sadly trouble those that
are forced to hear them. And the more constant the greater trouble.
Who would not be weary of their lives that must be forced to undergo
this vexation still without intermission? And yet the devil can
advance the trouble a little higher by the apparatus or artificial<a id="FNanchor_336_336" href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> dread
which he puts upon the temptation in the manner of the injection; as
the roaring of the lion increaseth terror in the beasts of the field, who
without that would tremble at his presence; and as the thundering
and lightning at the giving of the law increased the fear of Israel, so
when Satan is upon this design, he shakes as it were the house, and
makes a noise that the fright may be increased.</p>

<p>3. <i>Suspicious fears of being excluded out of God’s eternal decree of
election is another of his affrightments.</i> This is when Satan boldly
takes upon him to determine God’s secret counsel concerning any
man; peremptorily asserting that he is none of God’s elect. In which
case he often doth only inject the suspicion confidently, without offer
of proof; or if he use arguments, they never amount to a proof of his
assertion; neither is it possible they should, for these are among
‘God’s secrets,’ and out of Satan’s reach, though possibly they may
prove the person to be not converted at present. So that this kind of
trouble differs exceedingly from those disquiets of temptation which
frequently men suffer about their state of regeneration. And indeed
the question should not be confounded, it being of great concern to
men when their peace is assaulted to be able to observe the difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
betwixt these two assertions, ‘Thou are not elected,’ and ‘Thou art
not yet regenerated.’ Seeing—the latter being granted—there yet
remains a hope of the probability or possibility of that man’s conversion
afterwards. The suspicions of non-conversion are more common,
and not so dangerous; nay, in unregenerate persons the fears of their
being yet in that condition, being joined with diligence and care to avoid
the danger, are necessary and advantageous; but the former being
granted, all hopes are, together with that concession, laid off, which
must needs make the affrightment intolerable. In this we may
observe,</p>

<p>[1.] That Satan, for the better management of this design, doth not
only inject these suspicions <i>in the most dreadful language</i>—as, ‘Thou
art a lost and damned wretch, hopelessly miserable to all eternity;
God hath not elected thee to life, but prepared for thee, as a vessel of
wrath, the lake of fire and brimstone for ever,’ &amp;c.—but also he doth
assert them with the highest peremptoriness imaginable, as if he had
authority from God to pronounce a sentence of condemnation against
a man. This must needs amaze the afflicted unspeakably.</p>

<p>[2.] In this he also <i>observes his advantages</i>; for there are some men
so sadly suited to this design, that Satan comes better to speed upon
them than others. Usually he fixeth his eyes,</p>

<p><i>First, Upon young persons at their first serious attendances upon,
and considerations of, Scripture truths.</i> Their hearts are then tender.
Youth hath a natural tender-heartedness. We find them coupled
together in Rehoboam’s character: 2 Chron. xiii. 7, ‘When Rehoboam
was young and tender-hearted.’ And they are apt to receive
strong impressions. When those who were formerly mindless of their
spiritual concern begin to be serious, they can no sooner fall upon a
consideration of those weighty doctrines, that there are sheep and goats,
some saved and some damned, that the blessed are few in comparison of
the many that take the broad way to destruction, and that these were
from eternity ordained unto life, and these only, &amp;c.; no sooner, I
say, begin they to ponder these things, but Satan is ready with his suspicion,
‘And what dost thou know but thou art one of these excluded
wretches? If but few are saved, a thousand to one thou art none of
them; for why should God look upon thee more than another?’
These are his first essays<a id="FNanchor_337_337" href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> with young men beginning to be serious,
in which afterward he proceeds with greater boldness as he seeth
occasion.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, He also doth this to persons that are <i>some way quickened
to a devotional fear of God and care of their souls, but withal are
ignorant, and not able distinctly to apprehend and orderly to range
the doctrines of the Scriptures into a due consistency with one another</i>.
Their careful fears make them inquire into what God hath said concerning
the everlasting state of men; and before they can be able to
digest the principles of religion, Satan sets some truths edgeways
against them, which put them into great affrightment; while, through
their ignorance, other truths, appointed and declared for the satisfaction
of the minds of those that hunger and thirst after righteousness,
cannot come in to their relief. How startling must the truths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
God’s election be when they stand forth alone, and are not accompanied
with the invitations of the gospel, that promise pardon and acceptance
to all that will come in and submit to Christ! Satan usually holds
such kind of men to the consideration of those truths that have the
most dismal aspect; and while they are stopped there, they can draw
forth no other conclusions than these, that they are in hazard, and,
for aught they know, utterly lost.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, Satan hath also this plot against those that by some <i>grievous
iniquity, or long continuance in sin, have highly provoked the Lord</i>.
Here he useth arguments from the heinousness of their iniquity:
Thou art a reprobate, because thou hast committed these great evils,
these are marks of damnation, &amp;c.; which arguments, though they be
of no value, and no way proving that for which they are brought, yet
Satan injecting suspicions, and their own consciences in the meantime
justly accusing, they so sink under their fear that they suffer
Satan to make what conclusion he will, and then they subscribe
to it.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, Above all, <i>melancholy persons give the devil the greatest
advantage to raise affrightments</i>. That distemper naturally fills men
with sad thoughts, and is credulous of the worst evil that can be
objected against him that hath it. Of itself, it can create the blackest
conceits and saddest surmises, and then believes its own fancy. When
Satan strikes in with this humour—<i>finguntque creduntque</i>—they are
the more confirmed in their suspicions; and the fright is the greater,
because they are as incredulous of what is good, if it be told them, as
they are apt to believe what is evil, and to believe it, because they fear
it, <i>dum timet credit</i>,—though no other reason were offered: but much
more when Satan, in a prophetic manner, foretells their misery, and
assures them they must never be happy.</p>

<p>[3.] The suspicions which the devil hath by these advantages
<i>raised up, he doth endeavour to increase, and to root them deeply in
the minds of them upon whom he hath thus begun</i>. And indeed, by frequent
inculcating the same thing, with his continued peremptoriness of
asserting the certainty of their non-election, he at last brings up very
many to a full persuasion that it is so; and besides other arts that he
may have, or exercise in this particular, he commonly practiseth upon
men by perverting the true intendment and use of the doctrine of
election. That there is such a thing as election, and that of a determinate
number, are truths undeniable; and the end of their discovery
in the gospel is the comfort and confirmation of the converted.
Here they may see God’s unchangeable love to them—how much they
stand engaged for the freeness of grace, and that the foundation of God
is sure, &amp;c.; for to this purpose doth our Saviour improve these doctrines,
John xvii. 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16. But nothing of this is spoken
to discourage any man from his endeavours, neither can any man
prove that he or any other is excluded out of the decree of election,
except in case of the sin against the Holy Ghost; neither is it possible
for the devil to prove any such thing against any man; neither ought
any to suppose himself not elect; but on the contrary, if he is willing
to forsake sin, and desirous to be reconciled to God, he ought to
apprehend a probability that he is elected, because the proffer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Christ is made to all that will receive him. And therefore should
men stop their ears against such suggestions, and not dispute that
with Satan, but rather hearken to the commands, exhortations, and
promises of Scripture, it being most certain that these ‘secret things
belong to God,’ Deut. xxix. 29, and are no man’s rule to walk by,
seeing ‘revealed things only belong to us;’ all this the devil perverts,
for he endeavours to make election the immediate object of
our faith, and our rule to walk by, as if it were necessary that every
man knew God’s eternal purpose concerning him before he begin his
endeavours. And as he argues some men into a perverse carelessness
upon the ground of election, making them to conclude that if they
are ordained to life, they shall be saved, though they live wickedly;
if they be not, they shall be damned, though they endeavour never so
much to the contrary; so he also argues some, from this doctrine,
into terrible fears of damnation, because they cannot be assured
aforehand that their names are written in heaven. And these dreadful
suspicions he doth labour to strengthen by some men’s unwary
handling of the doctrine of non-election. When some preachers unskilfully
urge the dangerous signs of reprobation, or speak severely of
God’s decrees, without due caution and promise of mercy to all penitent
sinners; or when some, unskilful in the methods of comforting
the distressed in conscience, because they are not able to shew the
afflicted their condition, or to speak ‘a word in season’ to quiet their
minds, and to direct them what course to take, do usually refer them
to God’s decree, and tell them, If God have decreed them to salvation,
they shall be saved; Satan doth industriously hold them there;
by this means he leads them from their promises and their duty, and
keeps them musing and poring upon election till they are bewildered,
and cannot find the way out. Thus have several continued under
their affrightments for many years.</p>

<p>[4.] We may observe, That when Satan hath brought them into
this snare, <i>he doth tyrannically domineer over them</i>. He doth deride
them under their trouble, and mock at them when their fear comes
upon them. And because now the very thought or hearing of election
is as a dagger to the heart, and a ‘dreadful sound in their ears,’ he
delights to repeat it to them; for the very naming of the word becomes
as dreadful as the sentence of condemnation to a malefactor,
being always accompanied with this reflection, Oh how miserable am
I that have no part nor portion in it! Besides, he doth busy their
minds with imaginary representations of hell, and sets before them, as
in a scheme, the day of judgment, the terrors of the damned, the
sentence against the goats on the left hand, the intolerable pains of
everlasting burnings, and that which is the misery of all these miseries,
the eternity of all. Thus he forceth their meditations, but still with
application to themselves; neither doth he suffer them to rest in the
night, but they are terrified with sad dreams, and the visions of the
night do disquiet them.</p>

<p>[5.] <i>How grievous this affrightment is</i>, I should next observe; but
that is partly expressed in the aforegoing particulars, and may yet
more fully appear by a consideration of these three things:</p>

<p><i>First, That a man hath nothing dearer to him than his soul.</i> Alas!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
that cannot be counterbalanced by the gaining of the whole world,
and to have no hope or expectancy of its salvation must needs be
terribly affrightful!</p>

<p><i>Second, These suspicions of non-election prevailing, all promises
and comforts are urged in vain, and they commonly return them back
again to those that offered them with this reply</i>, ‘They are true and
useful to those unto whom they appertain, but they belong not unto
me.’ Nay, all means are rejected as useless. If such be advised
to pray or read, they will in their fit of affrightment refuse all; upon
this reason, that they are not elected. And then to what purpose,
say they, is prayer, or any endeavours? For who can alter his
decree? And, indeed, if their affrightments continued at a height
without intermission, they would never do anything; but this is their
help, that some secret underground hopes which they espy not, do
revive, at least sometimes, and put them upon endeavours which,
through God’s blessing, become means of better information.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, Though Satan’s injections of non-election be altogether
unproveable, and withal so terrifying, that it might be supposed men
should not be forward in their belief of so great an unhappiness; yet
can he prevail so far <i>that the persons above named—especially the
melancholy—are made to believe him, and this chiefly by possessing
their imaginations with his frequent confident affirmations</i>. We see
it is a common practice to teach birds musical notes and sounds, which
is only by constant repetition, till a strong impression is made upon
their fancy; and thus may one man impose upon the imagination
of another with his songs or sayings; for what we hear often we
cannot forbear to repeat in our thoughts, being strongly fixed upon
our fancy. No wonder, then, if Satan, by often repeating, ‘Thou art
not elected, thou art damned,’ &amp;c., do form so strong an impression
upon the imagination, that poor amazed creatures learn to say after
him, and then take the echoes of their fancy to be the voice of conscience
condemning them. Now, then, if the unhappiness suspected
be the greatest beyond all comparison, if these suspicions entertained
cut off all succours of comfort that may arise from the promises of
God and the endeavours of man, if Satan can prevail with men to
entertain them with any persuasion—as we see he can—how dreadfully
will these persuasions recoil upon a man! And thus will his
thoughts run, ‘I am persuaded I am not elected; and if not elected,
then comforts and prayers are all in vain; and if these be in vain,
there is no possibility of salvation, nor the least hope of a <i>who knows</i>,
or a <i>peradventure</i>; and if that, oh unspeakably miserable!’ Under
these astonishing thoughts doth Satan exercise their hearts by suspicions
of non-election. But,</p>

<p>4. Sometimes he takes another course to affright men, and that
is by <i>injecting motions of some abominable sin or evil into their
minds, to the commission whereof he seems strongly to solicit</i>; yet not
with any full intention or expectation of prevalency, but with a
purpose to molest and disquiet. And for that end, he commonly
chooseth such sins as are most vile in their own nature, and most
opposite to the dispositions of men. Thus he injects thoughts of
uncleanness to a chaste person; thoughts of injustice and wrong to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
a just man; thoughts of revenge and cruelty to a weak man; thoughts
of rejoicing in the loss and misery of others to the merciful man. Or
else he injects motions to such sins wherein formerly men have been
overtaken, but have been made bitter by deep repentance; the very
thoughts whereof are now become most loathsome. And sometimes
he pursues men with thoughts of self-murder, even while there is
nothing of discontent or trouble in their minds to second such a temptation.
By this manner of proceeding he creates great affrightments to
the hearts of men. For,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>These are strange surprisals</i>; and persons under this kind of
trouble cannot but be amazed to find such thoughts within them,
which are most contrary to their dispositions, or their most serious
resolves. The chaste person tempted to uncleanness, or the just man
to revenge; the humble person urged to the same sin that cost him so
dear, &amp;c.; they wonder at their own hearts, and while they mistake
these temptations, by judging them to be the issues of their own
inclination, with astonishment they cry out, Oh, I had thought that I
had mortified these lusts, but what a strange heart have I! I see
sin is as strong in me as ever! And I have cause to fear myself, &amp;c.</p>

<p>[2.] And this is yet a greater trouble, because usually Satan takes
them <i>at some advantage of an offered occasion or opportunity</i>, then
he gives them a sudden push, and with importunity urgeth them
to take the time. This often affrights them into trembling, and their
fears do so weaken their purposes that their hazards are the greater,
in that they are astonished into an inactivity. So that in this case
the men of might do not readily find their hands.</p>

<p>[3.] Neither are these motions <i>sudden and transient glances, which
perish as soon as they are born</i>, though it be a very frequent thing
with Satan to cast in motions into the heart for trial sake, without
further prosecution; but he, in this case, pursues with frequent repetitions,
following hard after them, to the increase of the affrightment.
So that for a long time together men may be afflicted with these messengers
of Satan to buffet them; and though they may pray earnestly
against them that they may be removed, yet they find the motions
continue upon them. Which must needs be a hateful annoyance to
an upright heart, that doth know it to be only Satan’s design to
affright; much more must it afflict those that do not perceive the contriver
and end of such motions, but judge them to be the natural
workings of their own evil heart.</p>

<p>5. Satan can also affright men <i>by immediate impressions of fear
upon their minds</i>. He can do much with the imagination, especially
when persons are distempered with melancholy, for such are naturally
fearful, and any impressions upon them have the deepest, most piercing
operation. They are always framing to themselves dismal things, and
abound with black and dark conceits, surmising still the worst, and
always incredulous of what is good. Hence it is that sometimes men
are seized upon by fearfulness and trembling, when yet they cannot
give any tolerable account of a cause or reason why it should be so
with them. And others are excessively astonished with the shadows
of their own thoughts upon the meanest pretences imaginable.</p>

<p>That this is the work of Satan doth appear by unquestionable evi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>dence.
This was that ‘evil spirit’ which God sent between Abimelech
and the men of Shechem, Judges ix. 23. God permitted Satan, for
the punishment of them both, to raise fears and jealousies in the heart
of Abimelech against the men of Shechem, and in the hearts of the
men of Shechem against Abimelech. They were mutually afraid of
one another, and these fears wrought so far, that they were, for the
prevention of a supposed danger, engaged in treacherous conspiracies,
to the real ruin of them both. The ‘evil spirit’ that vexed Saul,
1 Sam. xvi. 14, was nothing else but sudden and vehement fits of
terror and inward fear, which the devil raised by the working up of his
melancholy. For we may observe these fits were allayed by music;
and also we might see by his disposition out of his fits, and by his
carriage in them, that inward fears were his tormentors; for, 1 Sam.
xviii. 9, it is noted that Saul eyed David, that is, his jealous fears
began to work concerning David, of whom it is said expressly, ver. 12,
‘that he was afraid because the Lord was with him,’ and when the
evil spirit came upon him his heart was exercised with these fears,
and accordingly he behaved himself when he cast the javelin at David
with a purpose to slay him. Upon any occasion, of trouble especially,
the devil was at hand to heighten his affrightment, insomuch that
when the supposed Samuel told him of his death, 1 Sam. xxviii. 20,
he was afraid to such a height that he ‘fell straightway all along on
the earth, and there was no strength in him.’ Neither must we suppose
that Satan in this kind of working is confined only to wicked
men; for there is nothing in this manner of affrightment which is inconsistent
with the condition of a child of God, especially when God
gives him up to trial or correction. Nay, many of God’s servants
suffer under Satan’s hand in this very manner. Let us consider the
troubles of Job, and we shall find that though Satan endeavoured to
destroy his peace by discomposure of spirit, by questioning his integrity,
by frightful injections of blasphemous thoughts, yet all these he
vanquished with an undaunted courage, the blasphemy he rejected
with abhorrency, his integrity he resolved he would not deny so long
as he lived, his losses he digested easily with a sober composed mind,
blessed God that gives and takes at pleasure; and yet he complains of
his fears, and his frequent surprisals thereby, insomuch that his friends
take notice that most of his trouble arose from thence: chap. xxii. 10,
‘A sudden fear troubleth thee;’ and he himself confesseth as much,
ix. 34, ‘Let not his fear terrify me ... but it is not so with me.’
So that it appears that Job’s inward distress was mostly from strong
impressions of affrighting fears.</p>

<p>These fears impressed upon the mind must needs be an unexpressible
trouble. There is nothing that doth more loosen the sinews and
joints of the soul, to the weakening and utter enfeebling of it in all its
endeavours, than fears; it scatters the strength in a moment. And
besides the present burden, which will bow down the backs of the
strongest, these fears have a special kind of envious magnanimity in
them. For (1.) they come by fits, and have times of more fierce and
cruel assaults, yet in their intervals they leave the heart in a trembling
fainting posture; for the devil gives not over the present fit till he
hath rent them sore, and left them, as he did the man’s son in Mark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
ix. 26, ‘as one dead’: so that it is no more to be reckoned compassion
and gentleness in Satan toward the afflicted that their fits are not constant,
than it can be accounted tenderness or kindness in a tyrant who,
when he hath racked or tormented a man as much as strength will
bear without killing out of hand, gives over for a time that the party
might be reserved for new torments. (2.) These fits usually return at
such times as the party afflicted seems to promise himself some little
ease, being designed to give the greater disappointment in intercepting
his expected comforts. Sleep and meat are the two great refreshments
of the distressed; these times Satan watcheth for his new
onsets. Job found it so in both cases; his meal-times were times of
trouble: chap. iii. 24, ‘My sighing cometh,’ that is, the fits of sighing
return, ‘before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters,’
And his sleeping-times were no better: vii. 13, ‘When I say, My
bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint; then thou
scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: so that my
soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than life.’ (3.) These fears
do make them feel the weight, not only of real present evils, but of all
others which the imagination can represent to them. So that the
sight or hearing of any sad thing afflicts them with surmises that this
will be their case. Hence are they full of misgiving thoughts. Sometimes
they fear that they shall at last fall off from God into some
scandalous sin, to the dishonour of God and religion, as that they shall
be apostates, and turn openly profane; sometimes they fear they shall
meet with some signal devouring judgment by which they shall one
day perish, as David said in the like case, ‘I shall one day perish by
the hand of Saul,’ [1 Sam. xxvii. 1.] Thus are they crucified betwixt
their present burden and future expectations of evil.</p>

<p>6. The last, and indeed the meanest, engine for the working of
affrightment, is <i>scrupulosity of conscience</i>. Satan vexeth the conscience
and distracteth the mind, by raising up <i>needless, groundless
fears concerning a man’s practice</i>. Where the ignorance of men or
their timorous dispositions do encourage Satan to this enterprise, there
he multiplies scruples upon them; so that, though they assent to the
doing of anything as good or lawful, yet are they constantly affrighted
from it by a suspicious fear that it may be otherwise.</p>

<p>This kind of trouble takes in almost all kind of actions. It extends
to the way of a man’s calling, the way of his management of it, the
rates he takes and the prices he gives for his commodities; our very
natural actions of sleeping, eating, drinking, company, recreation, are
not unconcerned. In all which the devil affrights the timorous conscience
that, <i>it may be</i> he hath offended: if he buys or sells, he is
disquieted with a <i>maybe</i> that he hath sold too dear, or bought too
cheap; if he eats or sleeps, he fears he hath been excessive, a sluggard
or a glutton: thus are some men molested in everything they do.</p>

<p>Neither is this kind of affrightment to be despised; for though often
it is a groundless fear, and so appears to be to discerning Christians,
yet those that are under this molestation think it bad enough. Though
it be not as a rack, that afflicts with violent pains, yet it is as those
kinds of punishments which at first are nothing, but by continuance
do tire men out with little ease, and so at last become intolerable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Besides, this is a multiplying trouble; for one scruple begets another,
and by continuance of scrupling, the conscience grows so weak and
unsteady, that everything is scrupled, and the man brought to a continual
affrightment of doing wrong in every action. Neither can all
men make use of the remedy that is prescribed for the cure of this
distemper, which is, that when such scruples cannot be removed by
reason, then either men should forbear the thinking upon such things
from whence scruples are apt to arise, or they should break them down
by violence, and go over the belly of their scruple to the performance of
their action. I deny not but that something may be done and endeavoured
this way; but any may see that it is not easy for every one to
do either of these: so that this is also a troublesome evil, from which
it is not easy to be discharged.</p>

<p>Besides the troubles already mentioned under the heads of discomposures
of spirit and affrightments, there is a third kind of trouble
which Satan gives to the children of God, and this may, for distinction
sake, be called <i>spiritual sadness</i>. These spiritual sadnesses <i>are troubles
raised in the mind, relating to the conscience and spiritual state or condition
of men</i>. They differ exceedingly from the two former sorts of
trouble: for, (1.) These troubles wholly concern the conscience in
point of regeneration, and men’s suitableness thereunto; whereas
simple discomposures of spirit firstly relate to outward things. (2.)
In these the conscience is immediately concerned, but in other troubles
the conscience is either wholly untouched, or wounded only secondarily,
by continuance and progress of the discomposure of the spirit. (3.)
In these troubles, conscience is the great instrument by which the
devil works; whereas, in the trouble of affrightments, the devil acted
alone, the heart being in the meantime uncompliant and resisting.
For the opening of this trouble I shall explain—</p>

<p>1. <i>The several degrees thereof.</i> It is a trouble of conscience unduly
aggravated by Satan, wherein he confines himself to the operations of
conscience. But then, as he suggests the troubles of men by the
voice of conscience, so he doth all he can to make it irregular in its
actings, and excessive in that irregularity. So that in this case the
conscience is evil, and employs itself in that mistake, to inquire into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
men’s regeneracy or holiness, always being either a neuter or an adversary,
and the devil helps this forward all he can.</p>

<p>The apostle, in Heb. x. 22, makes mention of an ‘evil conscience,’
and that chiefly as it doth occasion fear, hindering our comfortable
access to God. This the conscience doth when it doth not execute its
office aright, either in ‘not excusing’ when it ought, or in ‘accusing’
when it should not; and these false accusations cause different sorts
of troubles according to the variety of the matter for which it doth
condemn. Hence is it that there are three degrees of trouble of conscience
below the trouble of despair:—</p>

<p>[1.] The lowest degree is when <i>a regenerate person doth not positively
determine the case of his soul, whether he be regenerate or not,
but is only kept in suspense betwixt hope that he is, and fear that he is
not, the conscience in the meantime forbearing to witness for him,
though it hath just cause to excuse him</i>. This we may call a doubting
or questioning conscience; and though it comes far short of these distresses
in which some men are plunged upon the account of their souls,
yet is it a trouble, for their peace is hereby hindered and their desires
of satisfaction frustrated, which in matters of so great concern,
as are these of everlasting life and everlasting misery, must be very
disquieting. When the affections are earnest, their satisfaction cannot
be delayed without trouble; for ‘hope deferred makes the heart sick,’
Prov. xiii. 12; not only doth it faint under its doubts, but is by that
means so weak in its purposes that it is easily drawn to admit of
greater inconveniences, which may lay the foundation of more perplexing
disturbances.</p>

<p>That the conscience may be in such a distemper that it will not
witness for a man, when yet it cannot witness against him, is the
observation of those that have treated of the nature of conscience.<a id="FNanchor_338_338" href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a>
Sometimes it will not make application of God’s promises. Though it
will believe that he that forsakes sin is regenerate, that he that truly
repents shall be pardoned, yet it will not affirm for a man that he
forsakes sin or repents, though he really do so; or if it cannot deny
that, yet it will sometimes refuse to make that conclusion which one
would think would follow of itself by natural consequence, and so refuseth
to judge the person regenerate or pardoned, though it cannot
deny but that he forsakes sin and repents. The greatness of the blessing,
the remainders of unbelief, the deep sense of unworthiness, with
other considerations, do keep off the heart from making, as I may say,
so bold with the promises; but all this while the devil is doing his
utmost to aggravate these considerations, affrighting the conscience
from that just absolution which it ought to give.</p>

<p>[2.] Another degree of trouble arising from an evil conscience, is
when <i>the condition of a regenerate person is determined by conscience,
but falsely, to be very bad</i>. I must here, as some others have done,<a id="FNanchor_339_339" href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a>
for want of better terms, distinguish betwixt the state of regeneracy
and a man’s condition in that state, though the words <i>state</i> and <i>condition</i>
are used promiscuously the one for another. A man may be
in a regenerate state, and yet his condition in that state may be very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
bad and blameworthy, as not walking worthy of so holy a calling; as
a person may be a man, and yet unhealthy or languishing. Thus
many of the Asian churches were true churches, and yet in a bad
condition; some ‘lukewarm;’ some had ‘a name to live,’ and yet were
comparatively ‘dead,’ because their works were not full or ‘perfect
before God;’ and others had ‘left their first love.’ To this purpose
is that of the apostle, 2 Cor. xiii. 5, ‘Know ye not your own selves,
how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?’—εἰ μή τι
ἀδόκιμοί ἐστε—where the word ‘reprobate’ is not to be taken in the
strict, severe sense for one ‘not elected,’ but for one whose conversation
is not so sound and approved as it should be: for this relates not to
their being in Christ, but to their assurance of being in that state,
which the apostle affirms they might know, except the fault lay in
their negligent, careless conversation.</p>

<p>This kind of trouble then is of this nature: the conscience doth not
accuse a man to be unregenerate, yet it condemns him for a carriage
unsuitable to the gospel; and this sometimes when his actions are not
absolutely evil, but partly good, partly bad. When the conscience
condemns the actions as altogether sinful, because of some mixture of
infirmities, in which case we should imitate the apostle, in Rom. vii.,
who when by reason of the remainders of sin in him, he could not do
the good he would—that is, in such a manner and degree as he desired,
nor avoid the evil which he would so clearly and fully as he wished,
some imperfections in his best endeavours still cleaving to him; yet
his conscience took a right course, he was humbled for his imperfections,
but withal acquits himself in point of integrity; his conscience
testified, ver. 16, that he ‘consented to the law as good;’ and ver. 22,
that he ‘delighted in the law of God, after the inward man.’ But in
this case of spiritual trouble, the conscience takes all in the worst
sense; it only fixeth upon the imperfections, and makes them to serve
for proofs against the sincerity. Thus if a man in praying be troubled
with wandering thoughts, then a distempered conscience condemns
that prayer as a sinful profanation of the name of God. If the great
concern of God’s glory run along in such a way as is also advantageous
to the person in outward things, then will such a conscience condemn
the man for self-seeking, though his main design were truly the honour
of God. In all actions where there is infirmity appearing with the
most serious endeavours, or where God’s glory and man’s good are
twisted together, the disordered conscience will be apt to take part
with Satan, accusing and condemning the action. Yea, very often
when the actions are very good, no way justly reprovable, the conscience
shall condemn. If he have had peace, he shall be judged for security;
if he have faith in God’s promises, it will call it presumption; if he
have a zeal for God, it will be misinterpreted for carnal rigour; if he
have joy, it shall be misjudged to be natural cheerfulness or delusion;
in a word, all his graces shall be esteemed no better than moral virtues.
At this rate are the children of God put to great trouble, losing, as I
may say, the things they have wrought, sadly bemoaning their hardness
of heart, or want of faith and love, when in their carriage and
complainings, they give very high proofs of all. In this also Satan is
busy to nourish the conscience in its jealousies, and doth suggest many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
objections to confirm it in its distemper. The conscience is not always
of a peevish or perverse humour; for sometimes it will smite a man
for a miscarriage,—as it did to David when he cut off the lap of Saul’s
garment,—and yet not break his peace: which is a sufficient evidence
that it is put, in this case, far out of order; which advantage Satan
works upon to disquiet the heart, to make men unthankful for the
mercies they have received, and to incapacitate them for more. This,
for distinction sake, we may call the trouble of a grieved or dejected
conscience, according to that of Ps. xlii. 5, 11, ‘Why art thou cast
down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me?’ Though
such men are under God’s favour, yet they misdeem it, and think God
is angry with them; their heart pants, their soul thirsts, their tears are
their meat, they are ready to say unto God, ‘My rock, why hast thou
forsaken me?’ and though they have some hopes for the future, that
God ‘will command his loving-kindness,’ and that they ‘shall yet
praise him;’ yet their present apprehension of their spiritual wants
and weaknesses, and of the displeasure of God, which they suppose
they are under, makes them go mourning all the day.</p>

<p>[3.] The third degree of trouble of conscience is when the conscience
<i>peremptorily denies the state of regeneration</i>. Hereby a man that is
really regenerate, is concluded to be yet ‘in the gall of bitterness, and
bond of iniquity;’ his former hopes are taxed for self-delusion, and
his present state to be a state of nature. This trouble is far greater
than the two former, because the party is judged to be in greater
hazard, and by many degrees more remote from hope. It is the frequent
and sad thought of such, that if death should in that estate cut
off their days, oh, then they were for ever miserable! The fears and
disquiets of the heart on this account are very grievous, but yet they
admit of degrees, according to the ignorance of the party, the distemper
of the conscience, the strength of the objections, or severity of
the prosecution, in regard the conscience is now sadly out of order.
We may call this degree of grief, for distinction, ‘a wounded spirit;’
which how hard it is to be borne Solomon tells us, Prov. xviii. 14, by
comparing it with all other kind of troubles, which the spirit of a man
can make some shift to bear, making this heavier than all, and above
ordinary strength.</p>

<p>Some make inquiry what may be the difference betwixt a wounded
spirit in the regenerate and the reprobate? To which it may be answered,
(1.) That in the party’s apprehension there is no difference
at all; both of them may be compassed about with the sorrows of
death, and suppose themselves to be in the belly of hell. (2.) Neither
is there any difference in the degree of the trouble; a child of God
may be handled with as much seeming severity, as he whom God intends
for a future Tophet. (3.) Neither is there any such remarkable
difference in the working of the spirits of the one and other, that they
themselves at present, or others that are bystanders, can easily observe.
Yet a formal difference there is; for grace being in the heart of the
one, will in some breathing or pulse discover its life. And though
sometimes it acts so low or confusedly that God only can distinguish,
yet often those that are experienced observers will discover some real
breathings after God, and true loathing of sin, and other traces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
faith and love, that are not so discernible to the parties themselves.
(4.) But in God’s design the difference is very great; the wicked lie
under his lash as malefactors, but the regenerate are as patients under
cure, or children under discipline. (5.) And accordingly the issue
doth determine, that God’s intention in wounding their spirits were
not alike to both; the one at last coming out of the furnace as gold,
the other still remaining as reprobate silver, or being consumed as
dross. Thus have ye seen the nature and degree of spiritual sadness.</p>

<p>2. For the further explanation whereof I shall next shew you that
this is a usual trouble to the children of God.</p>

<p>Which, (1.) I might evidence from several <i>instances of those that
have suffered much under it</i>; as David, whose complaints in this case
are very frequent, and Heman, who left a memorial of his griefs in
Ps. lxxxviii. Jonah also, in the belly of the whale, had a sharp fit of
it, when he concluded that he was ‘cast out of God’s sight,’ and his
‘soul fainted within him,’ Jonah ii. 4, 7. Neither did Hezekiah
altogether escape it, for though his disquiet began upon another ground,
it ran him into spiritual trouble at last. But besides these, innumerable
instances occur. One shall scarce converse with any society of
Christians but he shall meet with some who, with sad complaints, shall
bemoan the burden of their hearts, and the troubles of their conscience.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>The provisions which God hath made in his word for such, is
an evidence that such distempers are frequent.</i> He that in a city shall
observe the shops of the apothecaries, and there take notice of the
great variety of medicines, pots, and glasses full of mixtures, confections,
and cordials, may from thence rationally conclude, that it is a
frequent thing for men to be sick, though he should not converse with
any sick person for his information. Thus may we be satisfied from
the declarations, directions, and consolations of Scripture that it is a
common case for the children of God to stand in need of spiritual
physicians and spiritual remedies to help them when they are wounded
and fainting. Solomon’s exclamation, ‘A wounded spirit who can
bear?’ shews that the spirit is sometimes wounded. The prophet’s
direction, ‘He that walks in darkness and sees no light, let him trust
in the Lord,’ [Isa. l. 10,] clearly implies that some there are that walk
in darkness. God’s creating the ‘fruit of the lips, Peace, peace;’ his
promises of restoring ‘comforts to mourners;’ his commands to others
to comfort them; do all inform us that it is a common thing for his
children to be under such sadnesses of spirit, that all this is necessary
for their relief.</p>

<p>(3.) <i>The reasons of this trouble</i> do also assure us of the frequency
of it; for of them we may say, as Christ speaks of the poor, [Mat.
xxvi. 11,] ‘we have them always with us;’ so that the grounds of
spiritual sadness considered, it is no wonder to find many men complaining
under this distemper. The reasons are,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>The malice of Satan</i>, who hath no greater revenge against a
child of God, when translated from the power of darkness to the kingdom
of Christ, than to hinder him of the peace and comfort of that
condition.</p>

<p>[2.] <i>The many advantages which Satan hath against us.</i> For the
effecting of this we cannot imagine that one so malicious as he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
will suffer his malice to sleep, when so many fair opportunities of
putting it in practice do offer themselves. For, <i>first, The questions
to be determined for settling the peace of the soul are very intricate,
and often of greater difficulty than doctrinal controversies</i>. How hard
is it to conclude what is the <i>minimum quod sic</i>, the lowest degrees
of true grace! or the <i>maximum quod sic</i>, the highest degree of sin
consistent with true grace! To distinguish betwixt a child of God at
the lowest, and a hypocrite or temporary believer at the highest, is
difficult. In mixed actions, to be able to shew how the soul doth
manage its respect to God, when the man hath also a respect to himself,
especially when it is under any confusion, is not easy. And in
these actions, where the difference from others of like kind lies only in
the grounds and motives of the undertaking, or where the prevailing
degree must distinguish the act in reference to different objects that
are subordinate to one another—as our loving God above the world
or ourselves, our fearing God above men, &amp;c.—it is not every one that
can give a satisfactory determination. <i>Second</i>, As the intricacies of
the doubts to be resolved give the devil an advantage to puzzle us,
so is the advantage heightened exceedingly <i>by the great injudiciousness
and unskilfulness of the greatest part of Christians</i>. These questions
are in their notion difficult; more difficult in their application to
particular persons, where the ablest Christian may easily be nonplussed;
but most difficult to the weak Christians. These Satan can
baffle with every poor objection, and impose what he will upon them.
<i>Third</i>, Especially having the advantage of <i>the working guilt of
conscience</i>, which he can readily stir up to present to a man’s remembrance
all his failings and miscarriages of what nature soever.
And when guilt rageth in an unskilful heart, it must needs create
great disquiet. <i>Fourth</i>, But most of all when our <i>natural fears are
awakened</i>; as when a man hath been under any great conviction,
though he be cured of his trouble, yet it usually leaves a weakness in
the part, as bruises and maims do in any member of the body, which
at the change of weather or other accidental hurt will renew their old
trouble; and then when fresh guilt begins to press hard upon the
conscience, not only do the broken bones ache, by the reviving of
former fears, but the impressions of his old suspicions, bad conceit of
himself, and jealousies of the deceitfulness of his heart, which had
then fixed themselves by a deep rooting, do now make him most
fearful of entertaining any good thought of himself. So that if any
consideration tending to his support be offered, he dare not come near
it, suspecting his greatest danger to lie on that hand. These advantages
considered, we should not think it strange that any child of God
is driven to spiritual sadness, as some do, but may rather wonder that
this is not the common condition of all Christians.</p>

<p>[3.] Another reason that must be assigned for these troubles is <i>divine
dispensation</i>. Such are his children, some so careless, others proud,
others stubborn, many presumptuous, that God is forced to correct
them by this piece of discipline, and to cure them by casting them
into a fever. Others of his children he thus exerciseth for other ends,
sometimes to take occasion therefrom of making larger discoveries of
his love; sometimes thereby preventing them from falling under some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
grievous miscarriage, or for the trial and exercises of their graces.
We may observe, accordingly, that there are three sorts of men that
usually have exercises of this kind.</p>

<p>(1.) Those who at their conversion are either <i>ignorant, melancholy,
or were grossly scandalous, are usually brought through with great
fear and sadness</i>. And this is so observable, that by the mistake of
men it is made a general rule that none are converted but they are
under great and frightful apprehensions of wrath and dismal terrors.
This indeed is true of some, but these ordinarily are the scandalous,
melancholy, and ignorant sort—though sometimes God may deal so
with others, for who can limit him? Yet are there many whose
education hath been good, and their instruction aforehand great, whose
conversion is so gradual and insensible, that they are strangers to these
troubles of conscience, and profess that if these heights of fear be
necessary to conversion, they must be at a loss; neither can they give
an account of the time of their conversion, as others may.</p>

<p>(2.) Those whose conversion was easy, when after their conversion
<i>they miscarry by any great iniquity, they meet with as great a measure
of terror and fear, and some think far greater, as those whose new
birth was more difficult</i>. David’s greatest troubles of soul came upon
him after he began to appear more public in the world; for then he
met with many temptations, and great occasions for God’s exercising
his discipline over him. I believe, when he kept his father’s sheep,
his songs had more of praises and less of complainings than afterward.
It is the opinion of some that God’s dealing in this kind of dispensation,
even when miscarriage is not the cause, is more sharp usually to
those whose conversion hath been most easy.</p>

<p>(3.) <i>There is another sort of men, to whom God vouchsafes but
seldom and short fits of spiritual joy, as breathing times, betwixt sharp
fits of soul-trouble, for necessary refreshment and recovery of strength</i>;
but the constant course which God holds with them is to exercise
them under fears, while he hides his face from them, and suffers Satan
to vex them, by urging his objections against their holiness and
integrity. Heman was one of this rank, and the great instance which
God hath given in his word for the support of others that may be in the
same case. For he testifies, Ps. lxxxviii., that he suffered the terrors of
God almost to distraction, and this from his youth up. It is not fit
for us too narrowly to question why God doth thus to his children,
seeing his ‘judgments are unsearchable,’ and his ‘ways past finding
out;’ but we may be sure that God sees this dealing to be most fit for
those that are exercised therewith. It may be to keep pride from
them, or to prevent them from falling into some greater inconvenience
or sin, unto which he takes notice of a more than ordinary proneness
in their disposition; or for the benefit of others, who may thereby take
notice what ‘an evil and bitter thing it is’ to sin against God, and
what a malicious adversary they have to deal with. Whoso shall consider
these reasons of spiritual sadness, must needs confess, that seeing
the advantages which men give to a malicious devil to vex their consciences
are so many and great, and the weakness of God’s children so
hazardous, for the prevention whereof, a wise, careful Father will
necessarily be engaged to exercise his discipline, it cannot be expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
but that spiritual troubles should be very frequent among the servants
of God.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Here it is requisite that I give satisfaction to this query.
Seeing that God doth sometime wound the consciences of his children,
and that Satan also wounds them, what are the differences betwixt
God and Satan in inflicting these wounds?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> For the right understanding of this question I shall propound
two things:</p>

<p>(1.) That it is a truth that <i>God doth sometimes wound the consciences
of his children</i>; and this,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>Before conversion</i>: but in order to it, as preparatory to that
change, men are then in their sins, walking in the vanity of their
minds. To translate them from this estate he awakens the conscience,
shews them their iniquities, and the danger of them, that at present
they are ‘in their blood,’ ‘children of wrath, as well as others,’ and
that without Christ they are miserable. The effect of this must
needs be serious consideration, deep thoughts of heart, with some
trouble; only as to the measure and degree there is great difference.
God doth not in the particular application of these things to the conscience
tie up himself exactly to the same manner and measure of
proceeding, though he keep still to his general method. Hence is it
that some, in regard of God’s gentle, leisurely dealing, and the frequent
interposure of encouragements, are, if compared with the case
of others, said to be allured and ‘drawn with cords of love.’ But
others have a remarkable measure of trouble, sharp fits of fear and
anguish; and those most commonly are such whose conversion is
more quick, and the change visible from one extreme to another, as
Paul, when converted in the midst of his persecuting rage, or those
whose ignorance or melancholy makes their hopes and comforts inaccessible
for the present. These troubles God owns to be the work of
his Spirit. The same Spirit, which is a ‘Spirit of adoption’ to the
converted, is a ‘spirit of bondage’ to these, Rom. viii. 16. And
accordingly we find it was so to the converts in Acts ii., who being
‘pricked in their hearts’ by Peter’s sermon, ‘cried out, Men and
brethren, what shall we do?’ The like did the jailor. And the promise
which God makes of calling the Jews, Zech. xii. 10, doth express
God’s purpose of dealing with them in this very method: ‘They shall
look upon him whom they have pierced, and shall mourn for him as
one that mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for
him; ... in that day shall be a great mourning.’</p>

<p>[2.] God also sometimes wounds the conscience of his children <i>after
conversion</i>; and this he doth to convince and humble them for some
miscarriage which they become guilty of.<a id="FNanchor_340_340" href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> As when they grow secure,
carnally confident of the continuance of their peace—when they are
carelessly negligent of duty and the exercises of their graces—when
they fall into gross and scandalous sins, or wilfully desert the ways of
truth, and in many more cases of like kind. When his children make
themselves thus obnoxious to divine displeasure, then God hides his
face from them, takes away his Spirit, signifies his anger to their consciences,
threatens them with the danger of that condition, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
whence follows grief and fear in the hearts of his people. In this
manner God expressed his displeasure to David, as his complaints in
Ps. li. do testify: ‘Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones
which thou hast broken may rejoice. Hide thy face from my sins.
Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy Holy Spirit from
me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>(2.) Notwithstanding all this, there is <i>a great difference betwixt
God and Satan in this matter</i>, which mainly appears in two things:—</p>

<p>[1.] <i>God doth limit himself in all the trouble which he gives his children,
to his great end of doing them good, and healing them</i>, and consequently
stints himself in the measure and manner of his work to
such a proportion as his wisdom sees will exactly suit with his end.
So that his anger is not like the brawlings of malicious persons that
know no bounds. He will not ‘always chide;’ his debates are in
measure, and this ‘lest the spirit should fail before him,’ Isa. lvii. 16.
So that when he wounds the conscience before conversion, it is but to
bring them to Christ, and to prevent their taking such courses as
might through delusion make them take up their stand short of him.
So much of mourning and fear as is requisite for the true effecting of
this, he appoints for them, and no more. When he wounds after conversion,
it is but to let them feel that it is an evil and bitter thing to
sin against him, that their ‘godly sorrow may work repentance’ suitable
to the offence, and that they may be sufficiently cautioned for the
time to come to ‘sin no more, lest a worse thing befall them.’ He that
afflicts not willingly, will put no more grief upon them than is necessary
to bring them to this. But Satan, when he is admitted—and God
doth often permit him in subservience to his design, to wound the
conscience—he proceeds according to the boundless fury of his malice,
and plainly manifests that his desire is to destroy and to tread them
down that they may never rise again. This though he cannot effect,
for God will not suffer him to proceed further than the bringing about
his holy and gracious purpose, yet it hinders not but that still his
envious thoughts boil up in his breast, and he acts according to his
own inclination. For it is with Satan as it is with wicked men. If
God employ them for the chastisement of his children, they consider
not who sets them on work, nor what measures probably God would
have them observe, but they propose to themselves more work than
ever God cut out for them; as Assyria, when employed against Jerusalem,
Isa. x. 7, had designs more large and cruel than was in God’s
commission. God had stinted him in his holy purpose; yet the
‘Assyrian meant not so, neither did his heart think so; but it was in
his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.’ So that when God
is ‘a little displeased,’ as he speaks, Zech. i. 15, they do all that lies
in them to help forward the affliction. Thus doth the devil endeavour
to make all things worse to God’s children than ever God intended.
Here is one difference betwixt God and Satan, in the wounding of
consciences. But,</p>

<p>[2.] They are yet further differenced, in that all that God doth in
this work is still <i>according to truth</i>. For if he signify to the unconverted
that they are in a state of nature, liable to the damnation of
hell, unless they accept of Christ for salvation upon his terms, this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
no more than what is true. God doth not misrepresent their case to
them at that time. Again, if he express his displeasure to any of his
converted children that have grieved his Spirit by their follies, by
setting before them the threatenings of his word, or the examples of
his wrath, he doth but truly tell them that he is angry with them,
and that <i>de jure</i>, according to the rigour of the law and the demerit
of their offence he might justly cast them off; but he doth not positively
say that, <i>de eventu</i>, it shall infallibly be so with them. But
Satan, in both these cases, goes a great way further. He plainly
affirms to those that are in the way to conversion, that God will not
pardon their iniquities, that there is no hope for them, that Christ will
not accept them, that he never intended the benefit of his sufferings
for them. And when the converted do provoke God, he sticks not to
say the breach cannot be healed, and that they are not yet converted.
All which are most false assertions. And though God can make use
of Satan’s malice, when he abuseth his children with his falsehoods to
their great fear, to carry on his own ends by it, and to give a greater
impression to what he truly witnesseth against them; yet is not God
the proper author of Satan’s lying, for he doth it of his own wicked
inclination. The effect of these desperate false conclusions, which is
the putting his children into a fear in order to his end, may be
ascribed to God; but the falsehood of these conclusions are formally
Satan’s work and not God’s; for he makes use of so much of Satan’s
wrath as may be to his praise, and the ‘remainder of his wrath he
doth restrain,’ [Ps. lxxvi. 10.]</p>

<p>I have discovered the nature and degrees of these spiritual troubles,
and that it is a common thing for the children of God to fall under
them. For the further opening of them I shall next discover,</p>

<p>3. The usual solemn occasions that do, as it were, invite Satan to
give his onset against God’s children; and they are principally these
six:—</p>

<p>[1.] <i>The time of conversion.</i> He delights to set on them when
they are in the straits of a new birth, for then the conscience is
awakened, the danger of sin truly represented, fear and sorrow, in
some degree, necessary and unavoidable. At this time he can easily
overdrive them. Where the convictions are deep and sharp, ready to
weigh them down, a few grains more cast into the scale will make the
trouble, as Job speaks, ‘heavier than the sand,’ [chap. vi. 3;] and
where they are more easy or gentle, yet the soul being unsettled, the
thoughts in commotion, they are disposed to receive a strong impression,
and to be turned, as wax to the seal, into a mould of hopelessness
and desperation. That this is one of Satan’s special occasions, we
need no other evidence for satisfaction than the common experience of
converts. Many of them do hardly escape the danger, and after their
difficult conquest of the troubles of their heart—which at that time
are extraordinarily enlarged—do witness that they are assaulted with
desperate fears that their sins were unpardonable, and sad conclusions
against any expectation of favour from the Lord their God. These
thoughts we are sure the Spirit of God will not bear witness unto,
because false, and therefore we must leave them at Satan’s door.</p>

<p>[2.] Another occasion which Satan makes use of, is the time of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
<i>solemn repentance for some great sin committed after conversion</i>.
Sometimes God’s children fall, to the breaking of their bones. What
great iniquities they may commit through the force of temptation, I
need not mention. The adultery and murder of David; the incest of
the Corinthian; Peter’s denial of Christ, with other sad instances in
the records of the Scriptures, do speak enough of that. These sins—considering
their heinousness, the scandal of religion, the dishonour
of God, the grieving of his Spirit, the condition of the party offending
against love, knowledge, and the various helps which God affords
them to the contrary, with other aggravating circumstances—being
very displeasing to God, their consciences at least, either compelled to
examination by God immediately, or mediately by some great affliction,
or voluntarily awakening to a serious consideration of what hath
been done, by the working of its own light, assisted thereunto by
quickening grace, 1 Cor. xi. 31, 32,—call them to a strict account.
Thence follow fear, shame, self-indignation, bitter weeping, deep
humiliation. Then comes Satan; he rakes their wounds, and by his
aggravations makes them smart the more. He pours in corrosives
instead of oil, and all to make them believe that their ‘spot is not the
spot of God’s children,’ [Deut. xxxii. 5;] that their backslidings
cannot be healed. An occasion it is, as suitable to his malice as he
could wish; for ordinarily God doth severely testify his anger to them,
and doth not easily admit them again to the sense of his favour. At
which time the adversary is very busy to work up their hearts to an
excess of fear and sorrow. This was the course which he took with
the incestuous Corinthian, taking advantage of his great transgressions
to ‘overwhelm him with too much sorrow,’ 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11.</p>

<p>[3.] Satan watcheth <i>the discomposures of the spirits of God’s children,
under some grievous cross or affliction</i>. This occasion also falls
fit for his design of wounding the conscience. When the hand of the
Lord is lifted up against them, and their thoughts disordered by the
stroke, suggesting at that time God’s anger to them and their sins, he
can easily frame an argument from these grounds, that they are not
reconciled to God, and that they are dealt withal as enemies. David
seldom met with outward trouble, but he at the same time had a
conflict with Satan about his spiritual condition or state, as his frequent
deprecations of divine wrath at such times do testify; ‘Lord,
rebuke me not in thy wrath,’ &amp;c. There is indeed but a step betwixt
discomposure of spirit and spiritual troubles, as hath been proved before.</p>

<p>[4.] <i>When Satan hath prepared the hearts of God’s children by
atheistical or blasphemous thoughts, he takes that occasion to deny their
grace and interest in Christ</i>, and the argument at that time seems unanswerable.
Can Christ lodge in a heart so full of horrid blasphemies
against him? Is it possible it should be washed and sanctified, when
it produceth such filthy, cursed thoughts? All the troubles of affrightment,
of which before, are improvable to this purpose.</p>

<p>[5.] Another spiritual occasion for spiritual trouble is <i>melancholy</i>.
Few persons distempered therewith do escape Satan’s hands. At one
time or other he casts his net over them, and seeks to stab them with
his weapon. Melancholy indeed affords so many advantages to him,
and those so answerable to his design, that it is no wonder if he make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
much of it. For, 1. Melancholy affects both head and heart; it affords
both fear and sadness, and deformed, misshapen, delirious imaginations
to work upon, than which nothing can be more for his purpose.<a id="FNanchor_341_341" href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a>
For where the heart trembles and the head is darkened, there every
object is misrepresented. The ideas of the brain are monstrous appearances,
reflected from opaque and dark spirits, so that Satan hath
no more to do but to suggest the new matter of fear. For that question,
Whether the man be converted, &amp;c., being once started, to a
mind already distempered with fear, must of itself, it being a business
of so high a nature, without Satan’s further pursuit, summon the utmost
powers of sadness and misreprehension<a id="FNanchor_342_342" href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> to raise a storm. 2. Besides,
the impressions of melancholy are always strong. It is strong in its
fears, or else men would never be tempted to destroy themselves; it is
strong in its mistakes, or else they could never persuade themselves of
the truth of foolish, absurd, and impossible fancies; as that of Nebuchadnezzar,
who by a delusive apprehension, believing himself to be a
beast, forsook the company of men, and betook to the fields to eat grass
with oxen. The imaginations of the melancholic are never idle, and
yet straitened or confined to a few things; and then the brain, being
weakened as to a true and regular apprehension, it frames nothing but
bugbears, and yet with the highest confidence of certainty. 3. These
impressions are usually lasting, not vanishing as an early dew, but
they continue for months and years. 4. And yet they have only so
much understanding left them as serves to nourish their fears. If
their understanding had been quite gone, their fears would vanish with
them, as the flame is extinguished for want of air; but they have only
knowledge to let them see their misery, and sense to make them apprehensive
of their pain.<a id="FNanchor_343_343" href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> And therefore will they pray with floods of
tears, unexpressible groanings, deepest sighing, and trembling joints,
to be delivered from their fears. 5. They are also apt after ease of
their troubles to have frequent returns. What disposition, all these
things being considered, can be more exactly shaped to serve Satan’s
turn? If he would have men to believe the worst of themselves, he
hath such imaginations to work upon as are already misshapen into a
deformity of evil surmising. Would he terrify by fears or distress by
sadness? he hath that already, and it is but altering the object, which
oftentimes needs not—for naturally the serious melancholic employs
all his griefs upon his supposed miserable estate of soul, and then he
hath spiritual distress. Would he continue them long under their
sorrows, or take them upon all occasions at his pleasure, or act them
to a greater height than ordinary? still the melancholic temper suits
him. This is sufficient for caution, that we take special care of our
bodies, for the preventing or abating of that humour by all lawful
means, if we would not have the devil to abuse us at his will.</p>

<p>[6.] <i>Sickness or death-bed</i> is another solemn occasion which the
devil seldom misseth with his will. Death is a serious thing; it represents
the soul and eternity to the life. While they are at a distance,
men look slightly upon these; but when they approach near to them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
men usually have such a sight of them as they never had before. We
may truly call sickness and death-bed an hour of temptation, which
Satan will make use of with the more mischievous industry, because he
hath but ‘a short time’ for it. That is the last conflict, and if he
miss that, we are beyond his reach for ever. So that in this case Satan
encourageth himself to the battle with a <i>now or never</i>. And hence we
find that it is usual for the dying servants of God to undergo most
sharp encounters. Then to tell them, when the soul is about to loose
from the body, that they are yet ‘in their blood’ ‘without God and hope,’
is enough to affright them into the extremest agonies, for they see no
time before them answerable to so great a work, if it be yet to do.
And withal they are under vast discouragements from the weariness
and pains of sickness, their understandings and faculties being also
dull and stupified, so that if at this last plunge God should not extraordinarily
appear to rebuke Satan and to pluck them out of these great
waters, as he often doth, by the fuller interposition of the light of his
face, and the larger testimony of his Spirit, after their long and comfortable
profession of their faith and holy walking, their light would
be ‘put out in darkness,’ and they would ‘lie down in sorrow.’ Yet
this I must note, that as desirous as Satan is to improve this occasion,
he is often remarkably disappointed, and that wherein he, it may
be, and we would least expect, I mean in regard of those who, through
a timorous disposition or melancholy, or upon other accounts, are, as
I may so say, ‘all their lifetime subject to bondage.’ Those men who
are usually exercised with frequent fits of spiritual trouble, when they
come to sickness, death-bed, and some other singular occasions of
trouble, though we might suspect their fears would then be working,
if ever, yet God, out of gracious indulgence to them, considering their
mould and fashion, or because he would prevent their extreme fainting,
&amp;c., doth meet them with larger testimonies of his favour, higher
joys, more confident satisfactions in his love, than ever they received
at any time before, and this, to their wonder, their high admiration,
making the times which they were wont to fear most, to be times of
greatest consolation. This observation I have grounded not upon one
or two instances, but could produce a cloud of witnesses for it. Enough
it is to check our forward fears of a future evil day, and to heal us of
a sighing distemper, while we afflict ourselves with such thoughts as
these: If I have so many fears in health, how shall I be able to go
through the valley of the shadow of death?</p>

<p>4. I have one thing more to add for these discoveries of these
spiritual troubles, and that is to shew you <i>the engines by which Satan
works them</i>, and they are these two, sophistry and fears.</p>

<p>I. <i>As to his sophistry</i>, by which he argues the children of God
into a wrong apprehension of themselves, it is very great. He hath
a wonderful dexterity in framing arguments against their peace; he
hath variety of shrewd objections and subtle answers to the usual
replies by which they seek to beat him off. There is not a fallacy by
which a cunning sophister would seek to entangle his adversary in
disputation, but Satan would make use of it; as I might particularly
shew you, if it were proper for a common auditory. Though he hath
so much impudence as not to blush at the most silly, contemptible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
reason that can be offered, notwithstanding he hath also so much wit
as to urge, though never true, yet always probable arguments. How
much he can prevail upon the beliefs of men, in cases relating to their
souls, may be conjectured by the success he hath upon the understandings
of men, when he argues them into error, and makes them
believe a lie. We usually say, and that truly, that Satan cannot in
any case force us properly to consent; yet considering the advantages
which he takes, and the ways he hath to prepare the hearts of men
for his impressions, and then his very great subtlety in disputing, we
may say that he can so order the matter that he will seldom miss of
his aim. It would be an endless work to gather up all the arguments
that Satan hath made use of to prove the condition or state of God’s
children to be bad. But that I may not altogether disappoint your
expectations in that thing, I shall present to your view Satan’s usual
topics, the commonplaces or heads unto which all his arguments may
be reduced. And they are,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>Scripture abused and perverted.</i> His way is not only to
suggest that they are unregenerate, or under an evil frame of heart,
but to offer proof that these accusations are true. And because he
hath to do with them that profess a belief of Scriptures as the oracles
of God, he will fetch his proofs from thence, telling them that he will
evidence what he saith from Scripture. Thus sometimes he assaults
the weaker, unskilful sort of Christians, Thou art not a child of God;
for they that are so are enlightened, translated from darkness, they
are the children of the light; but thou art a poor, ignorant, dark,
blind creature, and therefore no child of God. Sometimes he labours
to conclude the like from the infirmities of God’s children, abusing to
this purpose that of 1 John iii. 9, ‘He that is born of God doth not
commit sin,’ and ‘he cannot sin, because he is born of God,’ Thus
he urgeth it, Can anything be more plainly and fully asserted? Is
not this scripture? Canst thou deny this? Then he pursues, But
thou sinnest often; that is thine own complaint against thyself, thy
conscience also bearing witness to the truth of this accusation; therefore
thou canst be no child of God. Sometimes he plays upon words
that are used in divers senses—a fit engine for the devil to work by—for
what is true in one sense will be false in another; and his arguing
is from that which is true to that which is false. I remember one
that was long racked with that of Rev. xxi. 8, ‘The fearful and unbelieving,’
&amp;c., ‘shall have their part in the lake which burns with
fire and brimstone.’ From whence the party thus argued: The
proposition is true, because it is scripture, and I cannot deny the
assumption. ‘Fearful I am, because I am doubtful of salvation; and
unbelieving I am, for I cannot believe that I am regenerate, or in a
state of grace, and therefore I cannot avoid the conclusion.’ To the
same purpose he disputes against some from 1 John iv. 18, ‘There is
no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear; but thou art full of
fears, therefore thou lovest not God.’ Sometimes he makes use of
those scriptures that make the prevailing degree of our love and
respects to God above the world and the things of this life, to be the
characters of true grace; as that of John, ‘If any man love the world,
the love of the Father is not in him;’ and that of Christ, ‘If a man love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
anything more than me, he is not worthy of me: he that forsakes not
all for me cannot be my disciple,’ &amp;c. Then he urgeth upon them
their love of the world, and unwillingness to part with their estates;
and so brings the conclusion upon them. Instances might be infinite;
but by these you may judge of the rest. Let us now cast our eye
upon his subtlety in managing his arguments against men. 1. He
grounds his arguments on Scripture, because that hath authority with
it, and the very troubled conscience hath a reverence to it. 2. He
always suits his scriptures, which he thus cites, to that wherein the
conscience is most tender. If there be anything that affords matter
of suspicion or fear, he will be sure to choose such an arrow out of the
quiver of Scripture as will directly hit the mark. 3. Though in the
citation of Scripture he always urgeth a sense which the Holy Ghost
never intended, yet there will be always something in those scriptures
which he makes use of, which, in words at least, seem to favour his
conclusion; as appears in the instances now given. For when he
would conclude a man not to be a child of God because of his ignorance,
something of his argument is true: it may be the man is
sensible that his knowledge is but little, compared with the measures
which some others have; or that he is at a loss or confused in many
doctrinal points of religion; or hath but little experience in many
practical cases, &amp;c. This as it is true, so it is his trouble; and whilst
he is poring upon his defect, Satan claps an arrest upon him of a far
greater debt than God chargeth upon him, and from scriptures that
speak of a total ignorance of the fundamentals of religion, as that
there is a God, that Christ Jesus is God and man, the Redeemer of
mankind by a satisfaction to divine justice, &amp;c., or of a wilful ignorance
of the worth of the proffer of the gospel, or its reality, which is
discovered in the refusal of the terms thereof, he concludes him to be
in a state of darkness; whereas the ignorance which the man complains
of is not the ignorance which those scriptures intend. So in the next
instance, the sins which a child of God complains of are those of daily
incursion, which he labours and strives against; but that committing
sin mentioned in the text hath respect to the Gnostics, who taught a
liberty in sinning, and fancied a righteousness consistent with the
avowed practice of iniquity. Hence doth John, 1 Epist. iii. 7,
directly face their opinion in these terms, ‘Little children, let no man
deceive you; he that doth righteousness is righteous;’ and, ‘He that
is born of God’ neither doth nor can avouch a liberty of sinning, it
being contrary to the principles of the new nature. So that the
miscarriages of infirmity which the child of God laments in himself
are not the same with that of the text, upon which Satan grounds
the accusation. The like may be said of the third instance, from
Rev. xxi. 18. The threatening there is against such a fear to lose
the comforts of the world, that they dare not believe the gospel to be
true, and accept it accordingly; which is nothing to those fears and
doubtings that may be in a child of God, in reference to his happiness.
Thus in all the rest the fallacy lies in misapplying the Scripture,
to suit them to that wherein the conscience is tender, under a sense
which was never intended by them; yet in another sense, the thing
charged upon the conscience is true. (4.) Yet is Satan so subtle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
that when he disputes by such fallacious arguments, he chiefly endeavours
to draw off the defendant’s eye and consideration from that part
of the argument wherein its weakness lies, which in this case is always
in the abuse of the scripture to a wrong sense. This he doth, partly
from the advantage which he hath from the reverence that they carry
to Scripture; they believe it to be true, and are not willing to suspect
the sense; and many are so weak that if they should, Satan is so
cunning that he can easily baffle them in any distinction that they
can make. And partly from the sense they have of that whereof they
are accused, they feel themselves so sore in that place, and for that
very end doth Satan direct his scripture to hit it, that they readily
take it for granted that the hinge of the controversy turns upon it,
and that the whole dispute rests upon it. Now Satan having these
fair advantages, by a further improvement of them hides the weakness
of his argument. For, [1.] He takes that sense of the Scripture, in
which he misapplies it, for granted, and that with great confidence,
making as if there were no doubt there. [2.] He turns always that
part of the argument to them which they can least answer, pressing
them eagerly with the matter of charge, which they are as ready to
confess as he is to accuse them of, and aggravating it very busily.
And because the unskilful have no other direction for the finding the
knot of the controversy than Satan’s bustle—though he, like the lapwing,
makes the greatest noise when he is furthest from his nest, on
purpose to draw them into a greater mistake—they look no further;
and then, not being able to answer, they are soon cast, and striking in
with the conclusion against themselves, they multiply their sorrows,
and cry out of themselves as miserable.</p>

<p>[2.] Another piece of his sophistry is, the improving certain <i>false
notions, which Christians of the weaker sort have received, as proofs of
their unregeneracy or bad condition</i>. As there are vulgar errors concerning
natural things, so there are popular errors concerning spiritual
things. These mistakes in a great part have their original from the
fancies or misapprehensions of unskilful men. Some indeed have, it
may be, been preached and taught as truths, others have risen without
a teacher from mere ignorance, being the conclusions and surmises
which weak heads have framed to themselves, from the sayings or
practices of men, which have not been either so cleared from the
danger of mistake, or not so distinctly apprehended as was necessary.
These false inferences, once set on foot, are traditionally handed down
to others, and in time they gain among the simple the opinion of undoubted
truths. Now, wherever Satan finds any of these that are fit
for his purpose—for to be sure whatever mistake we entertain, he will
at one time or other cast it in our way—he will make it the foundation
of an argument against him that hath received it, and that with very
great advantage. For a falsehood in the premises will usually produce
a falsehood in the conclusion. And these falsehoods being taken for
granted, the devil is not put to the trouble to prove them. If then he
can but exactly fit them to something in the party which he cannot
deny, he forthwith carries the cause, and condemns him by his own
concessions, as out of his own mouth.</p>

<p>It is scarce possible to number the false notions which are already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
entertained among Christians relating to grace and conversion, much
less those that may afterward arise. But I shall mention some that
Satan frequently makes use of as grounds of objection.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, It is a common apprehension among the weaker sort, that
conversion <i>is always accompanied with great fear and terror</i>. This
is true in some, as hath been said, and though none of the preachers
of the gospel have asserted the universality of these greater measures
of trouble, yet the people, taking notice that many speak of their deep
humiliations in conversion, and that several authors have set forth
the greatness of distress that some have been cast into on that occasion—though
without any intention of fixing this into a general rule—have
from thence supposed that all the converted are brought to their
comforts through the flames of hell. Upon this mistake the devil
disquiets those that have not felt these extreme agonies of sorrow in
themselves, and tells them that it is a sure sign that they are not yet
converted. Though it is easy for a man that sees the falsehood of the
notion to answer the argument, yet he that believes it to be true cannot
tell what to say, because he finds he never was under such troubles,
and now he begins to be troubled because he was not troubled before,
or, as he supposeth, not troubled enough.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, Another false notion is, that a convert can <i>give an account of
the time and manner of his conversion</i>. This is true in some, as in Paul
and some others, whose change hath been sudden and remarkable,
though in many this is far otherwise; who can better give account that
they are converted, than by what steps, degrees, and methods they were
brought to it. But if any of these receive the notion, they will presently
find that Satan will turn the edge of it against them, and will
tell them that they are not converted, because they cannot nominate
the time when, nor the manner how, such a change was wrought.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, Some take it for granted that conversion is accompanied
with a <i>remarkable measure of gifts for prayer and exhortation</i>; and
then the devil objects it to them, that they are not converted, because
they cannot pray as others, or speak of the things of God so readily,
fluently, and affectionately as some others can. Thus the poor, weak
Christian is baffled for want of abilities to express himself to God and
men.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, False notions about <i>the nature of faith are a sad stumbling-block
to some</i>. Many suppose that saving faith is a certain belief that
our sins are pardoned, and that we shall be saved, making faith and
assurance all one. This mistake is the deeper rooted in the minds of
men because some have directly taught so, and those men of estimation,
whose words are entertained with great reverence by well-meaning
Christians. For whom notwithstanding this may be pleaded
in excuse, that they have rather described faith in its height than in
its lowest measures. However it be, those that have no other understanding
of the nature of faith can never answer Satan’s argument, if
he takes them at any time at the advantage of fear or doubting: for
then he will dispute thus, Faith is a belief that sins are pardoned,
but thou dost not believe this, therefore thou hast no faith. Oh,
what numbers of poor doubting Christians have been distressed with
this argument!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>, Some take it for a truth that <i>growth of grace is always
visible, and the progress remarkable</i>. And then because they can
make no such discovery of themselves, the devil concludes their grace
to be counterfeit and hypocritical.</p>

<p><i>Sixth</i>, Of like nature are some <i>mistaken signs of true grace, as that
true grace fears God only for his goodness</i>. And then if there be any
apprehension of divine displeasure impressed upon the heart, though
upon the necessary occasion of miscarriage, they, through the devil’s
instigation, conclude that they are under ‘a spirit of bondage,’ and
their supposed grace not true, or not genuine at least, according to
that disposition which the New Testament will furnish a man withal.
It is also another mistaken sign of grace, that it doth direct a man to
love God singly for himself, without the least regard to his own salvation;
for that, they think, is but self-love. Now, when a child of
God doth not see his love to God so distinct, but that his own salvation
is twisted with it, Satan gets advantage of him, and forceth him
to cast away his love as adulterate and selfish. Like to this mistake,
but of a higher strain, is that of some, that where grace is true, it is
so carried forth to honour God, that the man that hath it can desire
God may be honoured though he should be damned. God doth not
put us to such questions as these, but upon supposition that this is
true, the grace of most men will be shaken by the objection that
Satan will make from thence; he can and will presently put the mistaken
to it, Canst thou say thou art willing to go to hell, that God
may be glorified? If not, where is thy grace? From such mistakes
as these he disputes against the holiness of the children of God; and
it is impossible but that he should carry the cause against those who
grant these things to be true. Satan can undeniably shew them that
their hearts will not answer such a description of a convert or gracious
heart as these false notions will make. So long then as they hold
these notions they have no relief against Satan’s conclusions; no comfort
can be administered till they be convinced that they have embraced
mistakes for truths. And how difficult that will be in this
case, where the confidence of the notion is great, and the suspicion
strong, that the defect is only in the heart, hath been determined by
frequent experience already.</p>

<p>[3.] The third piece of Satan’s sophistry from whence he raiseth
false conclusions, is his <i>misrepresentation of God</i>. In this he directly
crosseth the design of the Scriptures, where God in his nature and
dealings is so set forth, that the weakest, the most afflicted and tossed,
may receive encouragement of acceptance, and of his fatherly care
over them in their saddest trials. Yet withal, lest men should turn
his grace into wantonness, and embolden themselves in sin because of
his clemency, the Scriptures sometimes give us lively descriptions of
his anger against those that wickedly presume upon his goodness, and
continue so to do. Both these descriptions of God should be taken
together, as affording the only true representation of him. He is so
gentle to the humbled sensible sinner, that ‘he will not break their
bruised reed, nor quench their smoking flax,’ [Mat. xii. 20.] And so
careful of health that, for their recovery, he will not leave them altogether
unpunished, nor suffer them to ruin themselves by a surfeit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
upon worldly comforts; yet with ‘the froward he will shew himself froward,’
Ps. xviii. 26. And ‘as for such as turn aside unto their
crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of
iniquity,’ Ps. cxxv. 5. He will ‘put out the candle of the wicked,’
for he sets them in ‘slippery places, &amp;c., so that they are cast down
into destruction, and brought into desolation as in a moment; they
are consumed with terrors,’ [Ps. lxxiii. 19.] Now Satan will sometimes
argue against the children of God, and endeavour to break their
hopes by turning that part of the description of God against them,
which is intended for the dismounting of the confidence of the wicked,
and the bringing down of high looks. By this means he wrests the
description of God to a contrary end, and misrepresents God to a
trembling afflicted soul. This he doth,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, By misrepresenting <i>his nature</i>. Here he reads a solemn
lecture of the holiness and justice of God, but always with reflection
upon the vileness and unworthiness of the person against whom he
intends his dart. And thus he argues: Lift up thine eyes to the
heavens, behold the brightness of God’s glory: consider his unspotted
holiness, his infinite justice. The heavens are not clean in his sight; how
much more abominable and filthy then art thou! His eyes are pure,
he cannot wink at nor approve of the least sin; how canst thou then
imagine, except thou be intolerably impudent, that he hath taken such
an unclean wretch into his favour? He is a jealous God, and will by
no means acquit the guilty; canst thou then with any show of reason
conclude thyself to be his child? He beholds the wicked afar off; he
shuts out their prayer; he laughs at their calamity; he mocks when
their fear comes; and therefore thou hast no cause to think that he
will hear thy cry, though thou shouldst make many prayers. It cannot
be supposed that he will incline his ear. It is his express determination,
that if any man regard iniquity in his heart, the Lord will
not hear his prayer. This, and a great deal more will he say. And
while Satan speaks but at this rate, we may call him modest, because
his allegations are in themselves true, if they were applied rightly.
Sometimes he will go further, and plainly belie God, speaking incredible
falsehoods of him: but because these properly appertain to
a higher sort of troubles, of which I am next to speak, I shall not
here mention them. However, if he stops here, he saith enough
against any servant of God that carries a high sense of his unworthiness.
For being thus brought to the view of these astonishing attributes,
he is dashed out of countenance, and can think no other, but that it
is very unlikely that so unworthy a sinner should have any interest in
so holy a God. Thus the devil affrights him off, turning the wrong
side of the description of God to him; and in the meantime hiding
that part of it that speaks Gods wonderful condescensions, infinite
compassions, unspeakable readiness to accept the humble, broken-hearted,
weary, heavy-laden sinner, that is prostrate at his footstool
for pardon. All which are on purpose declared in the description of
God’s nature, to obviate this temptation, and to encourage the weak.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, He misrepresents God <i>in his providence</i>. If God chastise
his children by any affliction, Satan perversely wrests it to a bad construction,
especially if the affliction be sharp, or seem to be above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
their strength, or frequent, and most of all if it seem to cross their
hopes and prayers; for then he argues, These are not the chastisements
of sons. God indeed will visit their transgressions with rods,
but his dealing with thee is plainly of another nature, for he ‘breaketh
thee with his tempests,’ And whereas he corrects his sons that serve
him in measure, thou art bowed down with thy trouble to distress and
despair: but he will lay no more upon his sons than they are able to
bear. He will not always chide his servants; but thou art afflicted
every morning. And besides, if thou wert pure and upright, surely
now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness
prosperous: for to his sons he saith, ‘Call upon me in the
day of trouble, I will deliver thee; and thou shalt glorify me,’ Ps. l.
15. Hence comes the complaint of many, that they are not regenerated,
because they think God deals not with them as with others. Oh, say
they, we know God chastiseth ‘every son whom he receiveth;’ but our
case is every way different from theirs, our troubles are plagues, not
rods; our cry is not heard, our prayers disregarded, our strength
faileth us, our hearts fret against the Lord, so that not only the
nature and quality of our affections, but the frame of our heart under
them, in not enduring the burden,—which is the great character
of the chastisement of sons, Heb. xii. 7,—plainly evinceth that we
are under God’s hatred, and are not his children. This objection,
though it might seem easy to be answered by those that are not
at present concerned, yet it will prove a difficult business to those
that are under the smart of afflictions. How much a holy and
wise man may be gravelled by it, you may see in Ps. lxxii., where
the prophet is put to a grievous plunge upon this very objection;
ver. 14, ‘All the day long have I been plagued, and chastised every
morning.’</p>

<p>And yet in all this Satan doth but play the sophister, working upon
the advantages which the nature of the affliction and the temper of
men’s hearts do afford him. For, 1. Afflictions are a great depth, one
of the secrets of God, so that it is hard to know what God intends by
them. 2. The end of the Lord is not discovered at first, but at some
distance, when the fruits thereof begin to appear. 3. The mind of
the afflicted cannot always proceed regularly in making a judgment
of God’s design upon them: especially at first, when it is stounded by
the assault, and all things in confusion; faith is to seek, patience
awanting, and love staggering. After it hath recollected itself, and
attained any calmness to fit it for a review of the ways of God and of
the heart, it is better enabled to fix some grounds of hope: Lam. iii.
19-21, ‘This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope,’ 4. Afflictions
have a light and a dark side, and their appearances are according
to our posture in which we view them: as some pictures, which if we
look upon them one way, they appear to be angels, if another way,
they seem devils. 5. Some men in affliction do only busy themselves
in looking upon the dark side of affliction. Their disposition, either
through natural timorousness or strong impressions of temptation, is
only to meditate terrors, and to surmise evils. These men out of the
cross can draw nothing but the wormwood and the gall, while others,
that have another prospect of them, observe mixtures of mercy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
gentleness, and do melt into submission and thankfulness. These,
considered together, are a great advantage to Satan in disputing against
the peace of God’s afflicted children, and it often falls out, that as he
doth misrepresent God’s design, so do they, urged by temptation, upon
that account misjudge themselves.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, He also misrepresents God <i>in the works of his Spirit</i>. If
God withdraw his countenance, or by his Spirit signifies his displeasure
to the consciences of any, if he permit Satan to molest them
with spiritual temptations, presently Satan takes occasion to put his
false and malignant interpretation upon all; he tells them that God’s
hiding his face is his casting them off; that the threatenings signified
to their conscience are plain declarations that their present state is
wrath and darkness; that Satan’s molestations by temptations shew
them to be yet under his power; that the removal of their former
peace, joy, and sensible delight which they had in the ways of God is
beyond contradiction an evidence that God hath no delight in them,
nor they in him; that their faith was but that of temporaries, their
joy but that of hypocrites, which is only for a moment. How often
have I heard Christians complaining thus: We cannot be in a state
of grace; our consciences lie under the sense of God’s displeasure,
they give testimony against us, and we know that testimony is true,
for we feel it. It is true, time was when we thought we had a delight
in hearing, praying, meditating, but now all is a burden to us, we
can relish nothing, we can profit nothing, we can remember nothing.
Time was when we thought we had assurance, and our hearts rejoiced
in us; sometimes we have thought our hearts had as much of peace
and comfort as they could hold, now all is vanished, and we are under
sad fears; if God had had a favour to us, would he have dealt thus
with us? Thus are they cheated into a belief that they never had
any grace; they take all for granted that is urged against them;
they cannot consider God’s design in hiding his face, nor yet can they
see how grace acts in them under these complainings; how they
express their love to God in their desires and pantings after him, in
their bewailing of his absence, in abhorring and condemning themselves,
&amp;c.; but their present feeling—and an argument from sense is
very strong—bears down all before it.</p>

<p>Thus doth Satan frame his arguments from misrepresentations of
God, which, though a right view of God would easily answer them,
yet how difficult it is for a person in an hour of temptation to dispel,
by a right apprehension of the ways of the holy God, doth abundantly
appear from Ps. lxxvii., where the case of Asaph, or whoever else he
was, doth inform us—1. That it is usual for Satan, for the disquieting
of the hearts of God’s children, to offer a false prospect of God. 2.
That this overwhelms their hearts with grief, ver. 3. 3. That the
more they persist in the prosecution of this method, under the mists of
prejudice, they see the less, being apt to misconstrue everything in
God to their disadvantage, ver. 3, ‘I remembered God, and was
troubled.’ 4. The reason of all that trouble lies in this, that they can
only conclude wrath and desertion from God’s carriage toward them.
5. That till they look upon God in another method, and take up better
thoughts of him and his providences, even while they carry the appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>ance
of severity, they can expect no ease to their complainings. For
before the prophet quitted himself of his trouble, he was forced to
acknowledge his mistake, ver. 10, in the misconstruction he made of
his dealings, and to betake himself to a resolve of entertaining better
thoughts of God, ver. 7. His interrogation, ‘Will the Lord cast off
for ever?’ &amp;c., shews indeed what he did once think, being misled by
Satan, but withal that he would never do so again. ‘Will the Lord
cast off for ever?’ is not here the voice of a despairing man, but of
one that, through better information, hath rectified his judgment, and
now is resolved strongly to hold the contrary to what he thought before:
as if he should say, It is not possible that it should be so; he will
not cast off for ever, and I will never entertain such perverse thoughts
of God any more. 6. But before they can come to this, it will cost
them some pains and serious thoughts. It is not easy to break these
fetters, to answer this argument, but they that will do so must appeal
from their present sense to a consideration of the issues of these dealings
upon other persons, or upon themselves at other times; for the
prophet, ver. 5, ‘considered the days of old, and the years of ancient
times;’ and ver. 6, he also made use of his own experience, calling
to remembrance that after such dealings as these, God by his return
of favour gave him ‘songs in the night.’</p>

<p>[4.] Another common head from whence this great disputant doth
fetch his arguments against the good condition and state of God’s
servants, is their <i>sin and miscarriages</i>. Here I shall observe two or
three things in the general concerning this, before I shew how he
draws his false conclusions from thence. As,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That with a kind of <i>feigned ingenuity</i><a id="FNanchor_344_344" href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> he will grant a difference
betwixt sin and sin—betwixt sins reigning and not reigning,
sins mortified and not mortified; betwixt the sins of the converted
and the unconverted; and upon this supposition he usually proceeds.
He doth not always, except in case of great sins, argue want of regeneration
from one sin; for that argument, This is a sin, therefore
thou art not a convert, would be easily answered by one that knows
the saints have their imperfections; but he thus deals with men:
These sins whereof thou art guilty are reigning sins, such as are inconsistent
with a converted estate, and therefore thou art yet unregenerated.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, He produceth usually, for the backing of his arguments, such
scriptures as <i>do truly represent the state of men unsanctified</i>; but then
his labour is to make the parties to appear suitable to the description
of the unregenerate. And to that purpose he aggravates all their
failings to them; he makes severe inquiries after all their sins, and if
he can charge them with any notorious crime, he lays load upon that,
still concluding that a regenerate person doth not sin at such a rate as
they do.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, This is always a <i>very difficult case</i>; it is not easy to answer
the objections that he will urge from hence; for, (1.) If there be the
real guilt of any grievous or remarkable scandal which he objects,
the accused party, though never so knowing, or formerly never so
holy, will be hardly put to it to determine anything in favour of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
estate. [1.] The fact cannot be denied. [2.] The Scripture nominates
particularly such offences as render a man unfit for the kingdom of
God. [3.] Whether in such cases grace be not wholly lost, is a
question in which all are not agreed. [4.] However, it will be very
doubtful whether such had ever any grace. The Scripture hath given
no note of difference to distinguish betwixt a regenerate and unregenerate
person in the acts of murder, adultery, fornication, &amp;c. It
doth not say the regenerate commits an act of gross iniquity in this
manner, the unregenerate in that, and that there is a visible distinction
betwixt the one and the other, relating to these very acts. And
whatever may be supposed to be the inward workings of grace in the
soul, while it is reduced to so narrow a compass as a spark of fire raked
up in ashes, yet the weight of present guilt upon the soul, when it is
charged home, will always poise it toward the worst apprehensions
that can be made concerning its state. Former acts of holiness will
be disowned under the notion of hypocrisy; or if yet owned to be true,
they will be apt to think that true grace may be utterly lost. Present
acts of grace they can see none, so that only the after-acts of repentance
can discover that there is yet a being and life of grace in them,
and till then they can never answer Satan’s argument from great sins.
But, (2.) In the usual infirmities of God’s children the case is not so
easy. For the Scriptures give instances of some whose conversations
could not be taxed with any notorious evils; who, though they were
not ‘far from the kingdom of God,’ yet were not ‘of the kingdom of
God,’ [Mark xii. 34:] a freedom then from great sins is not pleadable as
an undoubted mark of grace. And if others that are not converted may
have no greater infirmities than some that are, the difference betwixt
the one and the other must depend upon the secret powers of grace
giving check to these infirmities and striving to mortify them; and
this will be an intricate question. The apostle, Rom. vii. 15, notes
indeed three differences betwixt the regenerate and unregenerate in
this case of sins of infirmity. [1.] Hatred of the sin before the commission
of it: ‘What I hate, that do I.’ [2.] Reluctancy in the act:
‘What I would, that do I not.’ [3.] Disallowance after the act: ‘That
which I do, I allow not.’ Yet seeing natural light will afford some
appearances of disallowance and reluctancy, it will still admit of
further debate whether the principles, motives, degrees, and success
of these strivings be such as may discover the being and power of real
grace.</p>

<p>While Satan doth insist upon arguments from the sins of believers
for the proof of an unconverted estate, he only aims to make good
this point, that their sins are reigning sins, and consequently that they
cannot be in so good a condition as they are willing to think. And
to make their sins to carry that appearance, his constant course is to
aggravate them all he can. This is his design, and the means by
which he would effect it. His great art in this case is to heighten
the sins of the regenerate. This he doth many ways. As,</p>

<p>(1.) <i>From the nature of the sin committed, and the manner of its
commission</i>; and this he chiefly labours, because his arguments from
hence are more probable, especially considering what he fixeth upon
usually is that which may most favour his conclusion: as, [1.] If any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
have fallen into a great sin which a child of God doth but rarely
commit, then he argues against him thus: They that are in Christ do
mortify the flesh with the affections and lusts, they cast away the
works of darkness; and these works of the flesh are manifest, Gal.
v. 19, ‘Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry,
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations,’ &amp;c. ‘Because of these
things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.’
‘Be not therefore partakers with them;’ ‘have no fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darkness,’ Eph. v. 6, 11. But thou hast not put
these away, nor mortified them, as thy present sin doth testify, therefore
thou art no child of God. [2.] If any do more than once or
twice relapse into the same sin, suppose it be not so highly scandalous
as the former, then he pleads from thence that they are backsliders
in heart, that they have broken their covenant with God, that
they are in bondage to sin. Here he urgeth, it may be, that of 2 Pet.
ii. 19, 20, ‘Of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
bondage.... The dog is returned to his vomit.’ [3.] Or if any have
by any offence more remarkably gone against their knowledge or
violated their conscience, then he tells them that they sin wilfully,
that they reject the counsel of the Lord, that they are the servants of
sin; ‘for his servants ye are to whom ye obey,’ Rom. vi. 16; ‘and
that where there is grace, though they may fall, yet it is still against
their wills,’ &amp;c. [4.] If he have not so clear ground to manage any
of the former charges against them, then he argues from the frequency
of their various miscarriages. Here he sets their sins in order before
them, rakes them all together, that he may oppress them by a multitude,
when he cannot prevail by an accusation from one or two acts;
and his pleading here is, Thou art nothing but sin, thy thoughts are
evil continually, thy words are vain and unprofitable, thy actions
foolish and wicked, and this in all thy employments, in all relations,
at all times. What duty is there that is not neglected or defiled?
what sin that is not some way or other committed? &amp;c. Can such a
heart as thine be the temple of the Holy Ghost? For the temple of
the Lord is holy, and his people are washed and cleansed, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These are all of them strong objections, and frequently made use of
by Satan, as the complaints of the servants of God do testify, who are
made thus to except against themselves: If our sins were but the
usual failings of the converted, we might comfort ourselves, but they
are great, they are backslidings, they are against conscience, they are
many; what can we judge but that we have hitherto deceived ourselves,
and that the work of conversion is yet to do? The objections
that are from great sins, or from recidivation<a id="FNanchor_345_345" href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> or wilful violation of
conscience, do usually prevail for some time against the best that are
chargeable with them; they cannot determine that they are converted,
though they might be so, so long as they cannot deny the matter of
fact upon which the accusation is grounded. Till their true repentance
give them some light of better information, they are in the dark,
and cannot answer the argument. Jonah being imprisoned in the
whale’s belly for his stubborn rebellion, at first concluded himself a
castaway: chap. ii. 4, ‘Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
Neither could he think better of himself till, upon his repentance, he
recovered his faith and hope of pardon: ‘Yet will I look again toward
thy holy temple.’ Yea, those objections that are raised from the multitude
and frequency of lesser failings, though they may be answered
by a child of God while his heart is not overshadowed with the mists
and clouds of temptation, yet when he is confused with violent commotions
within, his heart will fail him, and till he can bring himself
to some composure of spirit, he hath not the boldness to assert his
integrity. David was gravelled with this objection: Ps. xl. 12, ‘Innumerable
evils have compassed me about, mine iniquities have taken
hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than
the hairs on my head, therefore my heart faileth me.’</p>

<p>(2.) He aggravates the sinfulness of our condition from <i>the frequency
and violence of his own temptations</i>. It is a usual thing for
him to give young converts incessant onsets of temptation to sin.
Most commonly he works upon their natural constitution; he blows
the coals that are not yet quite extinguished, and that have greater
forwardness, from their own inclination, to kindle again, as lust and
passion. The first motions of the one, though it go no further than
those offers and risings up in the heart, and is there damped and kept
down by the opposing principle of grace; and the occasional outbreakings
of the other, which he provokes by a diligent preparation of
occasion from without, and violent incitations from within, furnish him
with sufficient matter for his intended accusations; and sometimes—being,
as it were, wholly negligent of the advantages which our tempers
give him, or not being able to find any such forwardness to these evils
in our constitution as may more eminently serve his ends—he satisfies
himself to molest us with earnest motions to any sins indifferently;
and all this to make us believe that sin is not crucified in us, which
some are more apt to believe, because they observe their temptations
to these sins to importune them more, and with greater vehemency,
than they were wont to do before; and this doth yet the more astonish
them, because they had high expectations that, after their conversion,
Satan would fall before them, and their temptations abate; that their
natures should be altered, and their natural inclinations to these sins
wholly cease; but now, finding the contrary, they are ready to cry
out—especially when Satan violently buffets them with this objection—We
are yet in our sins, and under the dominion thereof; neither can
it be that we are converted, because we find sin more active and
stirring than formerly; it is not then surely mortified in us, but lively
and strong. Though in this case it be very plain that temptations
are only strong, and sin weak, and that grace is faithfully acting its
part against the flesh, arguing, not that grace is so very weak, but
that Satan is more busy than ordinary. The sins are not more than
formerly, but the light that discovers them more is greater, and the
conscience that resents the temptation is more tender. Yet all this
doth not at first give ease to the fears that are now raised up in
the mind. They find sin working in them; their expectations of
attaining a greater conquest on a sudden, and with greater ease, are
disappointed, and the desire of having much makes a man think himself
poor; and withal they commonly labour under so much ignorance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
or perverse credulity, that they conclude they consent to everything
which they are tempted to, insomuch that it is long before these clouds
do vanish, and the afflicted brought to a right understanding of themselves.</p>

<p>(3.) From some <i>remarkable appearances of God doth Satan aggravate
our sinful condition</i>. If God shew any notable act of power,
he makes the beams of that act reflect upon our unworthiness with a
dazzling light. When Peter saw the power of Christ in sending a
great multitude of fishes into his net, having laboured all night before
and caught nothing, it gave so deep an impression to the conviction of
his vileness, that he was ready to put Christ from him, as being
altogether unfit for his blessed society: ‘Depart,’ saith he, ‘from me,
for I am a sinful man,’ [Luke v. 8.] If God discover the glorious
splendour of his holiness, it is enough to make the holiest saints, such
as Job and Isaiah, to cry out they are undone, being ‘men of unclean
lips,’ Isa. vi. 5; and to ‘abhor themselves in dust and ashes,’ Job
xlii. 6. The like may be said of any discovery of the rest of the
glorious attributes of God. Of all which Satan makes this advantage,
that the parties tempted should have so deep a consideration of their
unworthiness as might induce them to believe—as if it were by a
voice from heaven—that God prohibits them any approaches to him,
and that they have nothing to do to take God’s name within their
mouths. And though these remarkable discoveries of God, either by
his acts of power and providence, or by immediate impressions upon
the soul, in the height of contemplation, have ordinarily great effects
upon the hearts of his children, but not of long continuance; yet
where they strike in with other arguments, by which they were already
staggered as to their interest in God, they mightily strengthen them,
and are taken for no less than God’s own determination of the question
against them.</p>

<p>But this is not all the use that Satan makes of them; for from
hence he sometimes hath the opportunity to raise new accusations
against them, and to tax them with particular crimes, which, in a particular
manner, seem to prove them unregenerate. For what would
seem to be a clearer character of a man dead in trespasses and sins
than a hard heart, that can neither be sensible of judgments nor
mercies? This he sometimes chargeth upon the children of God,
from the great disproportion that they find in themselves betwixt the
little sense that they seem to have—and that which is disproportionable,
they reckon to be nothing—and the vast greatness of God’s
mercy or holiness. I have observed some to complain of utter
unthankfulness and insensibleness of heart—from thence concluding
confidently against themselves—because, when God hath remarkably
appeared for them in deliverances from dangers, or in unexpected
kindnesses, they could not render a thankfulness that carried any proportion
to the mercy. While they were in the highest admiration of
the kindness, saying, ‘What shall I render to the Lord?’ they were
quite out of the sight of their own sense and feeling, and thought they
returned nothing at all, because they returned nothing equivalent
to what they had received. Others I have known, who, from the
confusion and amazement of their spirit, when they have been over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>whelmed
with troubles, have positively determined themselves to be
senseless, stupid, past feeling, hardened to destruction; when, in both
cases, any might have seen the working of their hearts to be an
apparent<a id="FNanchor_346_346" href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> contradiction to what Satan charged them withal. For
they were not unapprehensive either of mercies or judgments; but, on
the contrary, had only a greater sense of them than they were able to
manage.</p>

<p>(4.) To make full measure, Satan doth sometimes aggravate the
miscarriages of those whom he intends to accuse, <i>by comparing their
lives and actions with the holy lives of some eminent servants of God,
especially such as they have only heard of and not known personally</i>.
For so they have only their virtues represented, without their failings.
Here Satan takes a liberty of declaiming against them: and though
he could never spare a saint a good word out of respect, yet that
others might be put out of heart and hope, he will commend the holiness,
strictness, care, constancy of dead saints to the skies. And then
he queries, Art thou such a one? Canst thou say thou art anything
like them, for a heavenly heart, a holy life, a contempt of the world,
a zeal for God, for good works, for patient suffering? &amp;c. All this
while not a word of their weaknesses. These, saith he, were the servants
of the Most High: their examples thou shouldst follow, if thou
expectest their crown. Had they any more holiness than they needed?
And if thou hast not so much, thou art nothing. What can humility,
modesty, and sense of guilt speak in such a case? They go away
mourning, their fears increase upon them, and what God hath set before
them, in the examples of his servants, for the increase of their
diligence, they take to be as a witness against them, to prove them
unconverted.</p>

<p>(5.) The last part of Satan’s sophistry is to lessen their <i>graces, that
so he may altogether deny them</i>. In this he proceeds upon such scriptures
as do assert the fruits of the Spirit, and urgeth for his foundation
that none are the children of God but such as ‘are led by the Spirit,’
[Rom. viii. 14;] and that he that hath ‘not the Spirit of Christ is none
of his,’ [Rom. viii. 9.] The necessity of faith, love, patience, humility,
with the fruits of these and other graces, he presseth; but still in
order to a demonstration, as he pretends, that such are not to be found
in those whose gracious state he calls into question, and consequently
that they are not the children of God.</p>

<p>The rule by which he manageth himself in this dispute is this:
The more graces are heightened in the notions, that must give an
account of their nature and beings, the more difficult it will be to find
out their reality in the practice of them. His design then hath these
two parts: 1. He heightens grace in the notion, or abstract, all he
can; 2. He lessens it in the concrete, or practice, as much as is possible,
that it may appear a very nullity, a shadow and not a substance.
I shall speak a little of both.</p>

<p>(1.) As to the first part of his design, he hath many ways by which
he <i>aggravates grace in the notion</i>. We may be sure, if it lie in his
way, he will not stick to give false definitions of grace, and to tell
men that it is what indeed it is not. He is a liar, and in any case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
whatsoever he will lie for his advantage, if he have hope his lie may
pass for current; but he cannot always use a palpable cheat in this
matter, where the nature of any grace is positively determined in
Scripture, except it be with the ignorant, or where the nature of grace
is made a business of controversy among men. I will not make conjectures
what Satan may possibly say in belying the nature of grace,
to make it seem to be quite another thing than it is; but shall rather
shew you the more usual plausible ways of deceit which herein he
exerciseth; and they are these that follow:—</p>

<p><i>First</i>, As the same graces have different <i>degrees in several persons,
and these different degrees have operations suitable</i>: some acts being
stronger, some weaker, some more perfected and ripened, others more
imperfect and immature; so when Satan comes to describe grace, he
sets it forth in its <i>highest excellencies and most glorious attainments</i>.
You shall never observe him to speak of graces at their lowest pitch,
except where he is carrying on a design for presumption, and then he
tells men that any wishing or woulding is grace; and every formal
‘Lord forgive me’ is true repentance; but, on the contrary, he offers
the highest reach of it that any saint on earth ever arrived at, as
essentially necessary to constitute its being; and tells them if they
have not that, they have nothing. Let us see it in the particulars.</p>

<p>[1.] Grace sometimes hath its <i>extraordinaries</i>, as I may call them.
We have both precept and example of that nature in Scripture, which
are propounded, not as the common standard by which the being and
reality of grace is to be measured, but as patterns for imitation, to
provoke us to emulation, and to quicken us in pressing forward. Of
this nature I reckon to be the example of Moses, desiring to be blotted
‘out of God’s book,’ [Exod. xxxii. 32,] whatever he meant by it, in
his love to the people; and the like of the apostle Paul, wishing himself
to be ‘accursed from Christ for his brethren’s sake,’ [Rom. ix. 3.]
Of this nature also we have many precepts; as, ‘rejoice evermore,’
[1 Thes. v. 16,] of ‘waiting and longing for the appearance of Christ,’
[2 Thes. iii. 5,] of ‘rejoicing when we fall into divers temptations,’ [James
i. 2,] and many more to this purpose, all which are heights of grace
that do rarely appear among the servants of God at any time.</p>

<p>[2.] Grace hath sometimes its <i>special assistances</i>. This is when
the occasion is extraordinary; but the grace befitting that occasion is
promised in ordinary, and ordinarily received. When God calls any
to such occasions, though compared with that measure of grace which
usually is acted by the children of God upon ordinary occasions, it is
a special assistance of the Spirit. Of this nature is that boldness which
the servants of Christ receive, to confess Christ before men in times of
persecution, and to die for the truth, with constancy, courage, and joy.</p>

<p>[3.] There are also singular <i>eminences of grace</i>, which some diligent,
careful, and choice servants of God attain unto, far above what the
ordinary sort arrive at. Enoch had his conversation so much in
heaven, that he was said to ‘walk with God,’ [Gen. v. 24.] David’s
soul was often full of delight in God. Some in the height of assurance
rejoice in God with ‘joy unspeakable, and full of glory,’ [1 Pet. i. 8.]
Moses was eminent in meekness, Job in patience, the apostle Paul in
zeal for promoting the gospel, &amp;c. Now Satan, when he comes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
question the graces of men, he presents them with these measures;
and if they fall short, as ordinarily they do, he concludes them altogether
graceless.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, Satan also can do much to heighten the <i>ordinary work
and usual fruits of every grace</i>. His art herein lies in two things.
[1.] He gives us a description of grace as it is <i>in itself</i>, abstracted
from the weakness, dulness, distraction, and infirmities, that are
concomitant with it, as it comes forth to practice. He brings to our
view grace in its glory, and without the spots by which our weakness
and Satan’s temptation do much disfigure it. [2.] He presents us
with grace in its <i>whole body</i>, completed with all its members, faith,
love, hope, patience, meekness, gentleness, &amp;c. From both these he
sets before those whom he intends to discourage a complete copy of
an exact holy Christian; as if every true Christian were to be found
in the constant practice of all these graces at all times, on all occasions,
and that without weakness or infirmity. Whereas indeed a
true Christian may be found sometimes evidently practising one grace,
and weak, or at present defective, in another. And sometimes the
best of his graces is so interrupted with temptation, so clogged with
infirmity, that its workings are scarce discernible.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, He hath a policy in heightening those <i>attainments and workings
of soul</i>, in things relating to God and religion, which are to be
found in <i>temporary believers</i>; which, because they sometimes appear
in the unconverted as well as in the converted, though all unconverted
men have them not, are therefore called common graces. This
he doth that he may from thence take occasion to disprove the real
graces of the servants of God; of whom ‘better things, and things
that accompany salvation,’ that is, special saving graces, are to be
expected, Heb. vi. 9. His way herein is, [1.] To shew the utmost
<i>bravery of these common graces</i>; how much men may have, how
far they may go, and yet at last come to nothing. For gifts,
they may have powerful eloquence, prophecy, understanding of
mysteries, faith of miracles. For good works, they may give their
estates to relieve the poor. In moral virtues they may be excellent,
their illumination may be great; they may taste the ‘good
word of God, and the powers of the world to come,’ Heb. vi. 4.
Their conversation may be ‘without offence,’ and their conscience
honest, as Paul’s was before his conversion. [2.] With these heights
of common grace, he compares <i>the lowest degree of special grace</i>.
And because the principles, motives, and ends which constitute the
difference betwixt these two, are, as it were, underground, more remote
from sense and observation, and oftentimes darkened by temptation;
he takes the boldness to deny the truth of grace, upon the
account of the small, inconsiderable appearance that it makes, confidently
affirming that special grace must of necessity make a far
greater outward show than these common graces. In what manner,
and to what end, Satan doth heighten grace in the abstract, we have
seen. It remains that we discover—</p>

<p>(2.) How he doth <i>lessen grace in the concrete</i>. This is the centre
of his design. He would not extol grace so much, but that he hopes
thereby to ‘condemn the generation of the just,’ and to make it appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
that there are few or none that are truly gracious. When he comes
to apply all this to the condition of any child of God, he deals
treacherously: and his cunning consists of three parts:—</p>

<p>[1.] He compares <i>the present state of any one with whom he deals,
to the highest attainments and excellencies of grace</i>; allowing nothing
to be grace, but what will answer these descriptions he had already
given. Here the tempter doth apparently make use of a ‘false
balance, and a bag of deceitful weights.’ For thus he puts them to
it: Thou sayest thou hast grace, but thou dost altogether deceive
thyself, for indeed thou hast none at all. Compare thyself with others
that were in Scripture noted as undoubtedly gracious, and thou wilt
see that in the balance thou art lighter than vanity. Abraham had
faith, but he believed above hope. Moses and Paul had love, but
they manifested it by preferring their brethren’s happiness before their
own. David was a saint, but he had a heart ravished with God.
The martyrs spoken of in Heb. xi., they could do wonders; they were
above fears of men, above the love of the world; they loved not their
lives to the death: how joyfully took they the spoiling of their goods!
how courageously did they suffer the sharpest torments! Besides,
saith he, all the children of God are described as sanctified throughout,
abounding with all fruits of righteousness; their faith is working;
their love still laborious; their hope produceth constant patience:
what art thou to these? That in thee which thou callest faith, or
love, or patience, &amp;c., it is not fit to be named with these. Thy fears
may tell thee that thou hast no faith, and so may thy works; thy
murmurings under God’s hand is evidence sufficient that thou hast no
patience. The little that thou dost for God, or especially wouldest do,
if it were not for thy own advantage, may convince thee that thou
hast no love to him; thy weariness of services and duties, thy confessed
unprofitableness under all, do proclaim thou hast no delight in
God nor in his ways. He further adds, for the confirmation of all
this: Consider how far temporaries may go, that shall never go to
heaven. Thou art far short of them; thy gifts, thy works, thy virtues,
thy illumination, thy conversation, thy conscientiousness, are nothing
like theirs: how is it possible then that such a one as thou, a pitiful,
contemptible creature, shouldest have anything of true grace in thee?
Thus he makes the application of all the discovery of grace which he
presented to them. Though he needs not urge all these things to
every one, any one of these particulars frequently serves the turn.
When a trembling heart compares itself with these instances, it turns
its back, yields the argument, and is ashamed of its former hopes, as
those are of their former confidence who flee from battle. Hence then
do we hear of these various complaints: one saith, Alas! I have no
grace, because I live not as other saints have done, in all exactness.
Another saith, I have no faith, because I cannot believe about<a id="FNanchor_347_347" href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> reason,
and contrary to sense, as Abraham did. A third cries out, he hath
no love to God, because he cannot find his soul ravished with desire
after him. Another thinks, he hath a hard heart, because he cannot
weep for sin. Another concludes against himself, because he finds
not a present cheerful resolve, while he is not under any question for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
religion, to suffer torments for Christ. Some fear themselves, because
temporaries in some particulars have much out-gone them.
You see how complaints may upon this score be multiplied without
end; and yet all this is but fallacy. Satan tells them what grace is
at the highest, but not a word of what it is at lowest; and so unskilful
is a tossed, weak Christian, that he in examining his condition
looks after the highest degrees of grace, as affording clearer evidence,
and not after the sincerity of it, which is the safest way for trial,
where graces are weak. In a word, this kind of arguing is no better
than that of children, who cannot conclude themselves to be men,
because their present stature is little, and they are not as tall as the
adult.</p>

<p>[2.] Another part of his cunning in lessening the real graces of
God’s children, is to take them at an advantage, <i>when their graces are
weakest, and themselves most out of order</i>. He that will choose to measure
a man’s stature while he is upon his knees, seems not to design to
give a faithful account of his height. No more doth Satan, who, when
he will make comparisons, always takes the servants of God at the
worst. And indeed many advantages do the children of God give him,
insomuch that it is no wonder that he doth so oft baffle them, but
rather a wonder that they at any time return to their comforts. <i>First</i>,
Sometimes he takes them to task while they are yet young and tender,
when they are but newly converted, before their graces are grown up,
or have had time to put forth any considerable fruit. <i>Second</i>, Or
when their graces are tired out by long or grievous assaults of temptation,
for then they are not what they are at other times. <i>Third</i>, When
their hearts are discomposed or muddied with fear, for then their sight
is bad, and they can so little judge of things that differ, that Satan can
impose almost anything upon them. <i>Fourth</i>, Sometimes he comes
upon them when some grace acts his part but poorly, as not having its
perfect work, and is scarce able to get through, sticking, as it were, in
the birth. <i>Fifth</i>, Or when the progress of grace is small and imperceptible.
<i>Sixth</i>, Or while in the absence of the sun, which produceth
flowers and fragrancy, and is the time of the singing of birds, Cant.
ii. 11, 12, it is forced to cast off its summer fruits of joy and sensible
delights, and only produceth winter fruits of lamenting after God,
longing and panting after him, justifying of God in his dealings and
condemning itself, all this while ‘sowing in tears’ for a more pleasing
crop. <i>Seventh</i>, Or while expectations are more than enjoyments: the
man it may be promised himself large incomes of greater measures of
comforts, ease, or strength, under some particular ordinances or helps
which he hath lately attained to, and not finding things presently to
answer what he hoped for, is now suspicious of his case, and thinks he
hath attained nothing, because he hath not what he would. <i>Eighth</i>,
Sometimes Satan shews them his face in this glass when it is foulest,
through the spots of some miscarriage. <i>Ninth</i>, Or he takes advantage
of some natural defects, as want of tears, which might be more usual
in former times, but are now dried up; or from the ebbings and uncertainty
of his affections, which are never sure rules of trials. <i>Tenth</i>,
Or in such acts that are of a mixed nature in the principles and motives,
where it may seem to be uncertain to which the act must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
ascribed as to the true parent. The heart of a gracious person being
challenged upon any of these points, and under so great a disadvantage,
being called out to give a proof of himself, especially in the view of
grace set forth in all its excellency and glory, shall have little to plead,
but will rather own the accusation. And the rather because,</p>

<p>[3.] It is another part of Satan’s cunning to urge them, whilst they
are thus at a stand, <i>with a possibility, nay, a probability of their mistaking
themselves, by passing too favourable an opinion formerly of
their actions</i>. To confirm them in this apprehension, <i>first</i>, He lays
before them the consideration of the deceitfulness of the heart, Jer.
xvii. 6, which, being so above all things, and desperately wicked beyond
ordinary discovery, makes a fair way for the entertainment of a
suspicion of self-delusion in all the former hopes which a man hath
had of himself. Satan will plainly speak it: Thou hast had some
thoughts and workings of mind towards God, but seeing they carry so
great a disproportion to rule and example, and come so far short of
common graces, it is more than probable that such poor, weak, confused
appearances are nothing. How knowest thou that thine adherence
to and practice of the command and services of God are any more
than from the power of education, the prevalency of custom, or the
impressions of moral suasion? How dost thou know that thy desires
after God, and thy delight in him, are any more than the products of
natural principles, influenced by an historical faith of Scripture doctrine?
It is oftentimes enough for Satan to hint this. A suspicious
heart, as it were greedy of its own misery, catcheth at all things that
make against it; and hence complains that it hath no grace, because
it sees not any visible fruits, or makes not a sufficient appearance at
all times when opposed or resisted; or because it wants sensible progress,
or gives not the summer fruits of praises, rejoicings, and delights
in God; or because it seems not to meet with remarkable improvements
in ordinances; or because it cannot produce tears and raise the
affections; and because the party doth not know but his heart might
deceive him in all that he hath done. Which the devil yet further
endeavoureth to confirm, <i>second</i>, By a consideration of the seeming
holiness and graces of such as believed themselves to be the children
of God, and were generally by others reputed so to be, who yet, after
a glorious profession, turned apostates. This being so great and undeniable
an instance of the heart’s deceitfulness, makes the poor
tempted party conclude that he is certainly no true convert.</p>

<p>Thus have we seen Satan’s sophistry in the management of those
five grand topics from whence he draws his false conclusions against
the children of God, pretending to prove that they are not converted;
or at least if they be in a state of grace, that they in that state are in
a very bad, unsuitable condition to it. For if his arguments fall short
of the first, they seldom miss the latter mark. This was his first
engine. Now follows,</p>

<p>II. The other engine by which he fixeth these conclusions, which,
though it be not argumentative, yet it serves to sharpen all his fallacies
against the comforts of God’s children—this is <i>fear</i>, which,
together with his objections, he sends into the mind. That Satan
can raise a storm and commotion in the heart by fear, hath been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
proved before. I shall now only in a few things shew how he doth
forward his design by astonishing the heart with his frightful thunderings.</p>

<p>[1.] <i>His objections being accompanied with affrightments, they pass
for strong undeniable arguments, and their fallacy is not so easily detected.</i>
Fear, as well as anger, darkens reason, and disables the
understanding to make a true, faithful search into things, or to give a
right judgment. As darkness deceives the senses, and makes every
bush affrightful to the passenger, or as muddied waters hinder the
sight, so do fears in the heart disable a man to discover the silliest
cheat that Satan can put upon it.</p>

<p>[2.] They are also very <i>credulous</i>. When fear is up, any suggestion
takes place. As suspicious incredulity is an effect of joy,—the
disciples at first hearing that Christ was risen, ‘for joy believed it
not’—so suspicious credulity is the effect of fear. And we shall
observe several things in the servants of God that shew a strange
inclination, as it were a natural aptitude, to believe the evil of their
spiritual estate which Satan suggests to them. As, <i>first</i>, There is a
great forwardness and precipitancy in the heart to close with evil
thoughts raised up in us. When jealousies of God’s love are injected,
there is a violent hastiness forthwith—all calm deliberation being
laid aside—to entertain a belief of it. This is more than once noted
in the Psalms. In this case, David acknowledgeth this hasty humour,
‘I said in my haste,’ Ps. xxxi. 22, and cxvi. 11. This hasty forwardness
to determine things that are against us without due examination,
Asaph calls a great weakness: ‘This is my infirmity,’ Ps. lxxvii. 10.
<i>Second</i>, There is observable in those that are under spiritual troubles,
a great kind of delight, if I may so call it, to hear threatenings rather
than promises, and such discourses as set forth the misery of a natural
state, rather than such as speak of the happiness of the converted;
because these things, in their apprehension, are more suitable to their
condition, and more needful for them, in order to a greater measure of
humiliation, which they suppose to be necessary. However, thus they
add fuel to the flame. <i>Third</i>, They have an aptitude to hide themselves
from comfort, and with a wonderful nimbleness of wit and
reasoning, to evade and answer any argument brought for their comfort,
as if they had been volunteers in Satan’s service to fight against
themselves. <i>Fourth</i>, They have also so great a blasting upon their
understanding, that Satan’s tempting them to doubt of their good
estate is to them a sufficient reason to doubt of it; and that is ground
enough for them to deny it, because Satan questions it.</p>

<p>[3.] These fears make all Satan’s suggestions <i>strike the deeper</i>;
they point all his arrows and make them pierce, as it were, ‘the joints
and marrow;’ they poison and envenom them, to the great increase of
the torment and hindrance of the cure; they bind the objections upon
them, and confirm them in a certain belief that they are all true.</p>

<p>We have now viewed Satan’s engines and batteries against the servants
of the Lord, for the destruction of their joy and peace, by
spiritual troubles; but these are but the beginnings of sorrows, if
compared with those distresses of soul which he sometimes brings
upon them. Of which next.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_IX_2">CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of his fourth way to hinder peace, by spiritual distresses. </i>1. <i>The
nature of these distresses; the ingredients and degrees of them.
Whether all distresses of soul arise from melancholy. </i>2. <i>Satan’s
method in working them; the occasions he makes use of, the arguments
he urgeth, the strengthening of them by fears. </i>3. <i>Their
weight and burden explained in several particulars.—Some concluding
cautions.</i></p>


<p>The last sort of troubles by which Satan overthrows the peace of
the soul, are <i>spiritual distresses</i>. These are more grievous agonies of
soul, under deepest apprehensions of divine wrath, and dreadful fears
of everlasting damnation, differing in nature and degree from the former
sorts of troubles; though in these Satan observes much-what the
same general method which he used in spiritual troubles last mentioned.
For which cause, and also that these are not so common as
the other, I shall speak of them with greater brevity. Herein I shall
shew—1. Their nature; 2. Satan’s method in working them: 3. Their
weight and burden.</p>

<p>1. The nature of spiritual distresses will be best discovered by a
consideration of those ingredients of which they are made up, and of
the different degrees thereof.</p>

<p>(1.) As to the ingredients, there are several things that do concur
for the begetting of these violent distresses. As,</p>

<p>[1.] There is usually a <i>complication of several kinds of troubles</i>.
Sometimes there are outward troubles and inward discomposures of
spirit arising from thence; sometimes affrightments of blasphemous
thoughts long continued, and usually spiritual troubles, in which their
state or condition have been called to question, have gone before.
Heman, who is as famous an instance in this case as any we meet
withal in Scripture, in Ps. lxxxviii., seems not obscurely to tell us so
much; his ‘soul was full of troubles,’ ver. 3; and in ver. 7 he complains
that God had afflicted him ‘with all his waves.’ And that these
were not all of the same kind, though all concurred to the same end,
he himself explains, ver. 8, 18, where he bemoans himself for the unkindness
of his friends: ‘Thou hast put away mine acquaintance;
lover and friend hast thou put far from me.’</p>

<p>[2.] These troubles drive at <i>a further end than any of the former</i>;
for their design was only against the present quietness and peace of
God’s children, but these design the ruin of their hopes for the future.
They are troubled, not for that they are not converted, but for that
they expect never to be converted. This is a trouble of a high nature,
making them believe that they are eternally reprobated, cut off from
God for ever, and under an impossibility of salvation.</p>

<p>[3.] These troubles have <i>the consent and belief of the party</i>. In
some other troubles Satan disquieted the Lord’s servants by imposing
upon them his own cursed suggestions, violently bearing in upon them
temptations to sin and blasphemy, or objections against their state of
regeneration, while in the meantime they opposed and refused to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
consent; but in these Satan prevails with them to believe that their
case is really such as their fears represent it to be.</p>

<p>[4.] They are troubles of <i>a far higher degree than the former</i>; the
deepest sorrows, the sharpest fears, the greatest agonies. Heman, Ps.
lxxxviii. 15, 16, calls them ‘terrors even to distraction:’ ‘While I
suffer thy terrors, I am distracted; thy fierce wrath goeth over me,
thy terrors have cut me off.‘</p>

<p>[5.] There is also God’s deserting of them in a greater measure than
ordinary, by withdrawing his aids and comforts. And, as Mr Perkins
notes, ‘If the withdrawing of grace be joined with the feeling of God’s
anger, thence ariseth the bitterest conflict that the soul of a poor creature
undergoes.’<a id="FNanchor_348_348" href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p>(2.) As to the different degrees of spiritual distresses, we must observe—That
according to the concurrence of all or fewer of these ingredients,
for they do not always meet together, though most frequently
they do; and according to the higher or lower degrees in
which these are urged upon the conscience, or apprehended and believed
by the troubled party, <i>these agonies are more or less; and
accordingly we may distinguish them variously</i>. As,</p>

<p>[1.] Some are desperate terrors <i>of cursed reprobates under desperation</i>.
These terrors in them are, in the greatest extremity, the very pit
of misery, of the same nature with those of the damned in hell, ‘where
the worm that never dies,’ is nothing else but the dreadful vexation and
torment of an accusing conscience.<a id="FNanchor_349_349" href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> They are commonly accompanied
with blaspheming of God, and an utter rejection of all means for
remedy; and though they sometimes turn to a kind of secure desperation,—by
which, when they see it will be no better, they harden themselves
in their misery, and seek to divert their thoughts—as Cain did,
betaking himself to the building of cities; and Esau, when he had
sold his birthright, despised it, and gave himself up to the pursuit of
a worldly interest;—yet sometimes these terrors end in self-murder,
as in Judas, who being smitten with dread of conscience, went and
hanged himself. We have many sad instances of these desperate
terrors. Cain is the first we read of; and though the account the
Scriptures give of him be but short, yet it is sufficient to let us see
what his condition was—Gen. iv. 11-16. First, He was cursed from
the earth. Of this part of his curse there were two branches: 1. That
his labour and toil in tillage should be great and greatly unsuccessful;
for thus God himself explains it, ver. 12, ‘When thou tillest the
ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength,’ The
earth was cursed with barrenness before to Adam, but now to Cain it
hath a double curse. 2. That he should be a man of uncertain abode
in any place: ‘A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth;’
not being able to stay long in a place by reason of the terrors of his
conscience. His own interpretation of it, ver. 14, shews that herein
lay a great part of his misery: ‘Thou hast driven me out this day
from the face of the earth.’ By which it appears that he was to be as
one that was chased out of all society, and as one that thought himself
safe in no place. Secondly, He was ‘hid from the face of God’—that
is, he was doomed to carry the inward feeling of God’s wrath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
without any expectation of mercy. Thirdly, His mind being terrified
under the apprehension of that wrath, he cries out that his ‘sin was
greater than it could be pardoned,’ or that his ‘punishment was greater
than he could bear; ‘for the word in the original signifies both sin
and punishment, עון. Take it which way you will, it expresseth
a deep horror of heart. If in the former sense, then it signifies
a conviction of the greatness of his sin to desperation; if in the latter
sense, then it is no less than a blasphemous reflection upon God, as
unjustly cruel. Fourthly, This horror was so great, that he was afraid
of all he met with, suspecting everything to be armed with divine
vengeance against him: ‘Every one that findeth me shall slay me,’
Or if that speech was a desire that any one that found him might kill
him, as some interpret,<a id="FNanchor_350_350" href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> it shews that he preferred death before that life
of misery. It seems, then, that God smote him with such terror and
consternation of mind, and with such affrightful trembling of body, for
his bloody fact, that he was weary of himself, and afraid of all men,
and could not stay long in a place. By these tokens, or some other way,
God sets his mark upon him, as upon a cursed miscreant, to be noted
and abhorred of all. Such another instance was Lamech, of whom
the same chapter speaks: 1. The sting of conscience was so great, that
he is forced to confess his fault—the interpretations of those that take
it interrogatively, ‘Have I slain?’ or, ‘If I have, what is that to you?’
&amp;c., are upon many accounts improper, much more are those so that
take it negatively—which, whether it were the abomination of polygamy,
as some think, by which example he had destroyed more than
Cain did; or if it were murder in a proper sense, as the words and
context plainly carry it, it is not very material to our purpose. However,
God smote him with horror, that he might be a witness against
himself. 2. He accuseth himself for a more grievous sinner and more
desperate wretch by far than Cain: ‘If Cain,’ ver. 24, ‘shall be avenged
sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.’ Which is as much as
to say, that there was as much difference betwixt his sin and Cain’s, as
betwixt seven and seventy-seven. 3. It seems also, by his discourse
to his wives, that he was grievously perplexed with inward fears, suspecting,
it may be, his very wives as well as others might have private
combinations against him; for the prevention whereof, he tells them
by Cain’s example of God’s avenging him. These two early examples
of desperation the beginning of the world affords; and there have been
many more since, as Esau and Judas. Of late years we have the
memorable instance of Francis Spira, one of the clearest and most
remarkable examples of spiritual horror that the latter ages of the
world were ever acquainted with. Yet I shall not dare to be confident
of his reprobation, as of Cain’s and Judas’s; because the Scripture hath
determined their case, but we have no such certain authority to determine
his.</p>

<p>[2.] <i>There are also distresses from melancholy</i>; which may be further
differenced according to the intenseness or remissness of the distemper
upon which they depend. For sometimes the imagination is so exceedingly
depraved, the fears of heart so great, and the sorrows so
deep, that the melancholy person, crying out of himself that he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
damned, under the curse of God, &amp;c., appears to be wholly besides
himself, and his anguish to be nothing else but a delirious, irrational
disturbance. There are too many sad instances of this. Some I have
known that for many years together have laboured under such apprehensions
of hell and damnation, that they have at last proceeded to
curse and blaspheme God in a most dreadful manner, so that they
have been a terror to all their friends and acquaintance. And though
sometimes they would fall into fits of obstinate silence, yet being urged
to speak, they would amaze all that were about them with the confident
averment of their damnation, with horrible outcries of their supposed
misery and torments, and with terrible rage against heaven. Some
in this distemper will fancy themselves to be in hell already, and will
discourse as if they saw the devils about them and felt their torture.
Such as these give plain discovery by their whole carriage under their
trouble, and some concomitant false imaginations about other things—as
when they fancy themselves to be in prison or sentenced to death,
and that torments or fire are provided for them by the magistrate, &amp;c.—that
it is only melancholy perverting their understanding that is the
cause of all their sorrow. Others there are who are not altogether
irrational, because in most other things their understanding is right;
yet being driven into melancholy upon the occasion of crosses or other
outward afflictions, they at last fix all their thoughts upon their souls;
and now their fancy becoming irregular in part, the whole of the
irregularity appears only in that wherein they chiefly concern themselves.
Hence they misjudge themselves, and condemn themselves to
everlasting destruction; sometimes without any apparent cause; and
sometimes they accuse themselves of such things as they never did.
They fear and cry out they are damned, but they cannot give a particular
reason why they should entertain these fears, neither can they
shew any cause why they should refuse the comforts of the promises
that are offered; but they say they know or are persuaded it is so, upon
no better account than this, It is so, because it is so. Or if they give
reasons of their imagination, they are commonly either feigned or frivolous;
and yet in all other matters they are rational, and speak or act
like men in their right minds. Of both these kinds of desperation I
shall speak nothing further. It is enough to have noted that such
there are, because the cure of the former is impossible, and the cure of
the latter doth wholly depend upon physic.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Some may possibly question, Whether all extraordinary
agonies of soul, upon the apprehension of eternal damnation, be not
the fruits of melancholy? And if not, then what may the difference
be betwixt those that proceed from melancholy, and those that are
properly the terrors of conscience?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> As to the first part of the question, I answer, <i>First, That all
spiritual distresses are not to be ascribed to melancholy</i>. For,</p>

<p>[1.] There are some melancholy persons who are never more free
from spiritual troubles—though frequently accustomed to them at
other times—than when, upon the occasion of some special trouble, or
sickness threatening death, there is <i>greatest cause to fear such onsets
upon the increase of melancholy</i>. Some such I have known.</p>

<p>[2.] Sometimes these distresses come <i>suddenly, their conscience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
smiting them in the very act of sin</i>; and these persons sometimes
such as are not of a melancholic constitution. Spira was suddenly
thunderstruck with terrors of conscience upon his recantation of some
truths which he held; and so were some of the martyrs.</p>

<p>[3.] Sometimes terrors that have continued long, and have been very
fierce, <i>are removed in a moment</i>. Now it is not rational to say that
melancholy only occasioned all such troubles, wherein bodies that are
not naturally of that complexion—and some such have been surprised
with terrors of conscience; if we will take a liberty to suppose an
accidental melancholy we must of necessity allow some time; and,
usually, some precedaneous<a id="FNanchor_351_351" href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> occasion to mould them into such a distemper.
Neither do the fears of melancholy cease on a sudden, but
abate gradually, according to the gradual abatement of the humour.
To say that Cain’s or Judas’s despair were the invasions of strong
melancholy, is not only beyond all proof, but also probability. Neither
is it likely that David, whose ruddy countenance and inclination to
music are tokens of a sanguine complexion, was always melancholic
under his frequent complaints of spiritual trouble.</p>

<p>[4.] They that read the story of Spira, and observe <i>his rational
serious replies</i> to the discourses that were offered him for his comfort
and his carriage all along, will have no cause to conclude his trouble
to be only melancholy; neither did the sober judicious bystanders
ascribe his distress to any such cause.</p>

<p>[5.] <i>The agony of Christ upon the cross</i>, under the sense of divine
wrath for our sins, though it were without desperation, is an undeniable
proof that there may be deep sense of God’s displeasure upon the soul
of man, which cannot be ascribed to melancholy.</p>

<p>Second, I answer, That it is not to be denied but that God <i>may
make use of that humour as his instrument, for the increase and continuance
of terrors upon the consciences of those whom he thinks fit to
punish, for any provocation, with spiritual desertion</i>, as he made use
of that distemper to punish Saul and Nebuchadnezzar. I speak not
here of those distresses which are nothing else but melancholy, such
as those before mentioned, of which physicians have given us frequent
histories,<a id="FNanchor_352_352" href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> though in this case the secret ways of God’s providences are
to be adored with humble silence; but of those terrors of conscience
which have a mixture of melancholy to help them forward, yet so as
that the judgment and reason are not thereby perverted. Spira, when
his case was hastily concluded by an injudicious friend to be a strong
melancholy, made this reply, Well, be it so, seeing you will needs
have it so; for thus also is God’s wrath manifested against me.
Which shews, [1.] That he believed God doth sometimes manifest
his wrath against man by melancholy. And [2.] That he denied this
to be his condition; for he still concluded that God sent the terrors of
his wrath immediately upon his conscience, as the sentence of his just
condemnation for denying Christ. Now when God doth make use of
melancholy, as his instrument in Satan’s hand, to make the soul of
man more apprehensive of his sin and God’s wrath—though he doth
not always make use of this means, as hath been said—while he still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
preserves the understanding from false imaginations, the distress is
still rational, and we have no cause to make any great difference betwixt
these troubles that have such a mixture of melancholy, and such
as have not. Neither must we say that then it is in the power of the
physician to remove or mitigate such spiritual distresses. For if God
see it fit to make use of melancholy for such a purpose, he can suspend
the power of physic, so that it shall not do its work till God hath
performed all his purpose. And the unsuccessfulness of remedies in
this distemper, while it seems to be wonderfully stubborn in resisting
all that can be done for cure, is more to be ascribed, in some cases, to
God’s design, than every physician doth imagine.</p>

<p>As to the latter part of the question, <i>How the terrors of melancholy
and those of conscience are to be distinguished?</i> I shall only say this;
that, as I said, we are not much concerned to make any distinction
where the distressed party acts rationally. It is true something may
be observed from these mixtures of melancholy; and thence may some
indications be taken by the friends of the distressed, which may be of
use to the afflicted party. Physic in this case is not to be neglected,
because, though God may permit that distemper in order to the terror
of the conscience, we are not of God’s counsel, to know how high he
would have it to go, nor how long to continue; but it is our duty,
with submission to him, to use all means for help. However, seeing
the physician is the only proper judge of the bodily distemper, it were
improper to speak of the signs of melancholy in these mixed cases, to
those that cannot make use of them. And as for these distresses of
melancholy that are irrational, they are of themselves so notorious,
that I need not give any account of them. There is usually a constitution
inclining that way, and often the parents or friends of the party
have been handled in the same manner before; or if their natural
temper do not lead them that way, there is usually some cross, trouble,
disappointment, or the like outward affliction, that hath first pressed
them heavily, and by degrees hath wrought them into melancholy,
and then afterward they come to concern themselves for their souls;
as that woman in Plater’s observations, who being long grieved with
jealousy upon grounds too just, at last fell into grievous despair, crying
out that God would not pardon her, that she was damned, that she felt
hell already and the torments of it, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_353_353" href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> Or there are some concomitant
deliriums, imaginations apparently absurd or false, &amp;c., all which
give plain discoveries of irrational distresses. And if there remained
any doubt concerning them, the consideration of all circumstances
together, by such as are sober and judicious, would easily afford a
satisfaction.</p>

<p>(3.) Having now confined the discourse to the spiritual distresses
of God’s children, that are not so oppressed with melancholy as to be
misled with false imaginations, I must next, concerning these distresses,
offer another observable distinction, which is this: <i>That they
are either made up of all the five forementioned ingredients, or only
of some of them, and so may be called total or partial</i>, though in each
of these there may be great differences of degrees.</p>

<p>[1.] <i>Sometimes then the children of God may be brought into total<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
distresses of conscience, even with desperation, and, that which is more
hideous, with blasphemy</i>, if Mr Perkins his observation hold true,
who tells us, ‘that they may be so overcharged with sorrow as to cry
out they are damned, and to blaspheme God:’<a id="FNanchor_354_354" href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> and we have no
reason to contradict it, when we observe how far David went in his
haste more than once. And whatever may be the private differences
betwixt these and the reprobates in their agonies—as differences there
are, both in God’s design, and their hearts, though not visible—yet if
we compare the fears, troubles, and speeches of the one and the other
together, there appears little or no difference which bystanders can
certainly fix upon. If it seems harsh to any that so horrid a thing
as despair should be charged upon the elect of God, in the worst of
their distresses, it will readily be answered: <i>First, That if we suppose
not this, we must suppose that which is worse</i>. If we like not to
say that God’s children may fall into despair, we must conclude, very
uncharitably, that they that fall into despair are not God’s children.
<i>Second</i>, It is easy to imagine a difference <i>betwixt partial and total
despair, betwixt imaginary and real</i>. The children of God, under
strong perturbation of spirit, may imagine themselves to do what they
do not, and so may bear false witness against themselves—professing
that all their hope of salvation is lost, when yet the root of their hope
may still remain in their hearts undiscovered. The habit may be
there when all visible acts of it are at present suspended, or so disguised
in a crowd of confused expressions that they cannot be known;
or, if they have real distrust of their salvation, yet every fit of real
diffidence is not utter desperateness; neither will it denominate a
man to be totally desperate, any more than every error, even about
fundamentals, will denominate a man a heretic.<a id="FNanchor_355_355" href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> For as it must be
a pertinacious error in fundamentals that makes a heretic, so it
must be a pertinacious diffidence that makes a man truly desperate.
<i>Third</i>, But <i>sometimes the children of God have only partial distresses</i>.
That is, they may have a great measure of some of the ingredients,
without mixture of the rest. Particularly, they may have a great
measure of the sense of divine wrath and desertion, without desperation.
The possibility of this is evident, beyond exception, in the example
of our blessed Saviour, when he cried out, ‘My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?’ [Mat. xxvii. 46.] None can ascribe
desperation to him without blasphemy; and if they should, the very
words, ‘<i>My</i> God, <i>my</i> God’—expressing his full and certain hope—do
expressly contradict them. Such an instance of spiritual distress
without desperation I take Heman to be. How high his troubles
were is abundantly testified in Ps. lxxxviii.; and yet that his hope
was not lost appears not only by his prayer for relief in the general—for
hope is not utterly destroyed where the appointed means for help
are carefully used—but by the particular avouchment of his hope in
God, in the first verses of that psalm, ‘O Lord God of my salvation,
I have cried day and night before thee.’</p>

<p>(4.) The last difference of spiritual distresses which I shall observe is
this, that some are more <i>transient fits and flashes of terror under a
present temptation, which endure not long; others are more fixed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
permanent</i>. The less durable distresses may be violent and sharp
while they hold. Temptations of diffidence may strongly possess a
child of God, and at first may not be repelled; and then before their
faith can recover itself, they vent their present sad apprehensions of
their estate, as Jonah did, chap. ii. 4, ‘I said, I am cast out of thy
sight,’ Many such fits David had, and in them complained at this
rate, ‘Why hast thou forsaken me? why castest thou off my soul?’
Ps. xxxi. 22, ‘I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine
eyes.’ Ps. cxvi. 11, ‘I said in my haste, All men are liars;’ which
was a great height of distrust, and too boldly reflecting upon God’s
faithfulness, considering the special promises that God had made to
him. Such sharp fits were those of Bainham and Bilney, martyrs,
whose consciences were so sorely wounded for recanting the truth
which they professed, that they seemed to feel a very hell within
them.</p>

<p>The more fixed distresses, as they are of longer continuance, so
they are often accompanied with the very worst symptoms; for when
in these agonies, no sun nor star of comfort appears to them for many
days, all hope that they shall be saved seems to be taken away, [Acts
xxvii. 20;] and being tired out with complaints and importunities,
without any answer, they at last reject the use of means. Some have
lain many years—as the paralytic man at the pool of Bethesda—without
cure; some from their youth up, as Heman complains. Some
carry their distresses to their death-bed, and it may be are not eased
till their souls are ready to depart out of their bodies, and then they
often end suddenly and comfortably. Some I could tell you of, who
on their death-bed, after grievous terrors, and many outcries concerning
their miseries of ‘blackness and darkness for ever,’ lay long
silent; and then on a sudden brake out into raptures of joy and
adoring admiration of the goodness of God, using that speech of the
apostle, Rom. xi. 33, ‘Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom
and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his
ways past finding out!’ Others go out of the world in darkness,
without any appearance of comfort. Such an instance was Mr
Chambers, as the story of his death testifies, mentioned by Mr Perkins,
in his treatise ‘Of Desertions,’ of whom this account is given:
that in great agonies he cried out, ‘he was damned,’ and so died.
The case of such is surely very sad to themselves, and appears no less
to others; yet we must take heed of judging rashly concerning such.
Nay, if their former course of life hath been uniformly good—for
who will reject a fine web of cloth, as one speaks, for a little coarse
list<a id="FNanchor_356_356" href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> at the end—especially if there be any obscure appearance of
hope—as that expression of Mr Chambers, ‘Oh that I had but one
drop of faith!’ is by Mr Perkins supposed to be—we ought to judge
the best of them. We have seen the nature of spiritual distresses in
the ingredients and differences thereof. We are now to consider,</p>

<p>2. Satan’s method in procuring them: which consists, (1.) In the
occasions which he lays hold on for that end. (2.) In the arguments
which he useth. (3.) In the working up of their fears, by which he
confirms men in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>(1.) <i>As to the occasions</i>, he follows much <i>the same course which
hath been described before in spiritual troubles</i>; so that I need not
say much, only I shall note two things:—</p>

<p>[1.] That it makes much for Satan’s purpose, if the party against
whom he designs <i>have fallen into some grievous sins</i>. Sins of common
magnitude do not lay a foundation suitable to the superstructure
which he intends. He cannot plausibly argue reprobation or damnation
from every ordinary sin; but if he finds them guilty of something
extraordinary, then he falls to work with his accusations. The most
usual sins which he takes advantage from, are, as Mr Perkins observes,
those against the third, sixth, and seventh command; sometimes those
against the ninth. Murder, adultery, perjury, and the wilful denial
of truth against conscience, are the crimes upon which he grounds his
charge, but most usually the last. Upon this, the distressed Spira,
and some of the martyrs. As for the other, the more private they are,
Satan hath oft the more advantage against them, because God’s secret
and just judgment will by this means ‘bring to light the hidden
things of darkness,’ [1 Cor. iv. 5,] and force their consciences to accuse
them of that which no man could lay to their charge, that he might
manifest himself to be ‘the searcher of the hearts, and trier of the
reins,’ [Rev. ii. 23.] Thus have many been forced to disclose private
murders, secret adulteries, and to vomit up, though with much pain
and torture, that which they have by perjury or guile extorted from
others.</p>

<p>[2.] Where Satan hath not these particular advantages, he doth
endeavour to prepare men for distresses, <i>by other troubles long continued</i>.
All men that are brought to despair of their happiness, must
not be supposed to be greater sinners than others. Some are distressed
with fears of eternal damnation, that are in a good measure able to
make Job’s protestation in these cases, chap. xxxi. 9, &amp;c., that their
‘heart hath not been deceived by a woman;’ that they have not laid
wait at their neighbour’s door; that they have not lift up their hand
against the fatherless, when they saw their help in the gate; that
their land doth not cry against them, nor the furrows thereof complain;
that when they saw the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
brightness, their heart hath not been secretly enticed, nor their mouth
kissed their hand; that they rejoiced not in the destruction of him
that hated them, nor lift up themselves when evil found him, &amp;c.
Notwithstanding all which, their fears are upon and prevail against
them. But then before Satan can bring them to consent to such
dismal conclusions against themselves, they must be extraordinarily
fitted to take the impression; either tired out under great afflictions,
or long exercised with fears about their spiritual estates, without intermixture
of comfort or ease, or their faculties broken and weakened by
melancholy. Any of these give him an advantage equivalent to that
of great sins. For though he cannot say to these, Your sins are so
enormous, that they are, considered themselves together with their
circumstances, sad signs of reprobation; yet he will plead that God’s
carriage towards them doth plainly discover that he hath wholly cast
them off, and left them to themselves, without hope of mercy.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>As for the arguments which he useth</i>, they are much-what from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
the same topics which he maketh choice of in bringing on spiritual
troubles. Only as he aims at the proof of a great deal more against
God’s children, than that they are not converted; so accordingly he
screws up his mediums for proof to a higher pin. His arguments
are,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>From scriptures wrested or misapplied.</i> His choice of scriptures
for this purpose, is of such places as either seem to speak most
sadly the dangerous and fearful estate of men, according to the first
view and literal representation of them, through the unskilfulness of
those that are to be concerned; or of such places as do really signify
the miserable unhappiness of some persons, who through their own
fault have been cut off from all hope, and the possibility of the like
to some others for the future. So that, in framing arguments from
Scripture, the devil useth a twofold cunning. <i>First</i>, There are some
scriptures which have the word <i>damnation</i> in them, applied to some
particular acts and miscarriages of men, when yet their intendment is
not such as the word seems to sound, or as he would make them to
believe. Now when he catcheth a child of God in such acts as are
there specified, if he finds that his ignorance or timorousness is such
as may render the temptation feasible, he presently applies damnation
to them, by the authority of those texts. For instance, that text of
Rom. xiv. 23, hath been frequently abused to that end, ‘He that
doubteth, is damned if he eat.’ The word ‘damned’ there, strikes
deep with a weak, troubled Christian that is not skilful in the word of
righteousness. For whether Satan apply it to sacramental eating, as
sometimes he doth to the ignorant, though contrary to the purpose of
the text, or to doubting in the general, he makes this conclusion out
of it: ‘Thou doubtest, or thou hast eaten the sacrament doubtingly,
therefore there is no hope for thee; thou art damned.’ Whereas all
this while, the devil doth but play the sophister in the abuse of the
signification of words. For that scripture evidently relates to the
difference that then was in the church, about eating those meats that
were unclean by Moses’s law; in which case the apostle doth positively
declare, that the difference betwixt clean and unclean meats is taken
away; so that a Christian might with all freedom imaginable eat
those meats that were formerly unclean, with this proviso, that he
were ‘fully persuaded in his own mind,’ [Rom. xiv. 5.] The necessity
of which satisfaction, he proves from this, that otherwise he should
offend his own conscience, which in that case must needs condemn
him, and that is the damnation that is there spoken of; as is more
evident by comparing this verse with the next foregoing, ‘Happy is
he that condemneth not himself.’ But he that doubteth, doth condemn
himself, because ‘he eats not of faith,’—that is, from full persuasion
of the lawfulness of the thing. This scripture then hath
nothing at all in it to the purpose for which Satan brings it. It doth
not speak of any final sentence of condemnation passed upon a man
for such an act; all and the utmost that it saith, is only this, that it
is a sin to go against the persuasion of conscience, and consequently it
puts no man further off salvation than any other sin may do; for which,
upon repentance, the sinner may be pardoned.</p>

<p>Another text which Satan hath frequently abused, to the very great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
prejudice of many, is that of 1 Cor. xi. 29, ‘He that eateth and
drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself.’
With this scripture he insults over the humble, fearful Christian,
who is sensible of his unworthiness of so great a privilege. Sometimes
he keeps him off long from the sacrament of the Lord’s supper,
upon this very score that such an unworthy wretch ought not to
make such near and familiar approaches to Christ. And if at last he
is persuaded to partake of this ordinance, then, taking advantage of
the party’s consciousness of his great vileness, and the very low
thoughts which he entertains of himself, he endeavours to persuade
him that now he hath destroyed himself for ever, and run upon his
own irrecoverable damnation. Thus he pleads it, Can anything be
more plain than that thou hast eaten and drunken unworthily? Thy
own conscience tells thee so; and can anything be more positively
asserted than this, that he that doth so, eateth and drinketh damnation
to himself? What then canst thou think of thyself, but that thou
art a damned wretch? Neither do I speak barely what may be supposed
Satan would say in this matter, but what may be proved by
many instances he hath said and urged upon the consciences of the
weak, who have from hence concluded, to the great distress of their
souls, that by unworthy receiving of the sacrament they have sealed
up their own condemnation; and all this by abusing and perverting
the sense of this text. For the unworthy receiving doth relate to the
miscarriages which he had taxed before, and it implies a careless, profane
eating; such as might plainly express the small or unworthy
esteem that they had in their hearts for that ordinance. And the
damnation there threatened is not final and irrevocable damnation,
but temporal judgment; as the apostle himself doth explain it in the
next verses; ‘For this cause many are sickly.... And if we would
judge ourselves we should not be judged.’ That is, as he further
explains it, we should not be thus chastened or afflicted; and the
word translated ‘damnation’ doth signify judgment—κρῖμα. At the
furthest, if we should take it for the condemnation of hell, all that is
threatened would be no more than this: that such have deserved, and
God in justice might inflict the condemnation of hell for such an
offence; which is not only true of this sin but of all others, which still
do admit of the exception of repentance. All this while this is
nothing to the poor humbled sinner, that judgeth himself unworthy in
his most serious examination and greatest diligence. Satan here plays
upon the unexactness of the translation, and the ignorance of the
party in criticisms; for it is not every one that can readily answer
such captious arguments.</p>

<p>[2.] But he hath another piece of cunning, which is this: <i>He doth
by a singular kind of art, threap upon men some scripture that really
speaks of eternal condemnation, without any sufficient evidence in
matter of fact for the due application of them, only because they cannot
prove the contrary</i>. His proceeding herein is to this purpose. First,
After he hath prepared his way, by forming their minds to a fearful
suspicion of their estate, he sets before them such scriptures as these:
God hardened the heart of Pharaoh: he hath prepared ‘vessels of
wrath, fitted for destruction.’ Christ prayed not ‘for the world:’ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
that concerning the Jews, ‘He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened
their hearts.’ Secondly, He confidently affirms that they are such.
Thirdly, He puts them to prove the contrary, and herein he sends
them to the search of God’s eternal decrees; in which art Satan, like
an <i>ignis fatuus</i>, leads them out of the way. And though he cannot
possibly determine what he affirms, he shifts off the positive proof
from himself, and leaves it upon them to make out, that they are not
thus determined of by God’s unchangeable purpose. And because
the tempted, under so great a cloud, have no such persuasion of their
present graces as may enable them to make sure their election by the
fruits of their vocation, they are beaten off from their hold, and are
brought to believe that the argument is unanswerable. Because they
cannot say they are converted, they conclude they must be damned,
overlooking the true answer that they might make, by keeping close
to the possibility or probability that they may be converted, and so
escape the damnation of hell. This general hope being of such high
concern to the distressed, for it is the first thing that must relieve
them till better evidence come in, it is Satan’s great policy to cheat
them of it, which he often doth by this method now declared.</p>

<p>(2.) Satan doth mainly endeavour <i>to misrepresent God to troubled
souls, and from thence he draweth out arguments against them</i>. In
the former case of spiritual troubles, he misrepresents God, in that he
represents only some attributes of his, not only distinct from, but in
opposition to others, by which he labours to conceal the sweet and
beautiful harmony that is among them; and also to make one attribute
an argument against the comfortable supporting considerations
which another would afford. He insists upon God’s justice without
respect of mercy, upon his holiness without any regard of his gracious
condescensions to the infirmities of the weak. But when it is his
business to bring any under spiritual distresses, he then misrepresents
God at a higher rate, and sticks not to asperse him with abominable
falsehoods. There are two lies which he commonly urgeth at this
time:—</p>

<p>[1.] He represents God as <i>a cruel tyrant, of a rigorous, unmerciful
disposition, that delights himself in the ruin and misery of men</i>. To
this purpose he rakes together the harshest passages of the Scripture,
that speak of God’s just severity against the wilful obstinate sinners,
that stubbornly contemn his offers of grace. God indeed hath cleared
himself of this aspersion, by solemn oath, Ezek. xxxiii. 11, ‘As I live,
saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
but that the wicked turn from his way and live.’ Yet the tempted
will sooner believe Satan’s suggestion than God’s oath; partly because
the sense of their vileness doth secretly sway them to think there is
reason that he should be so; partly because their fears incline them
to suspect the worst; and partly the uneasy tossings of their mind
long continued reviveth the natural frowardness of the spirit against
God. Which, how apt it is, when fretted with vexation, to entertain
harsh thoughts of God, may be seen in the answer of the slothful servant
to his lord, who returned his talent back again unimproved, with
a reflection importing that his master was such as none could please;
so severe that he was discouraged from making any attempt of serving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
him acceptably: Mat. xxv. 24, he said, ‘Lord, I knew thee that thou
art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering
where thou hast not strawed.’</p>

<p>[2.] He belies God further, by representing him as <i>designing the
ruin and misery of the tempted person in particular</i>. He would make
him believe that God had a particular spleen, as it were, against him
above other men, and that in all his dealings with, or concerning him,
he is but as a ‘bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places,’
[Lam. iii. 10,] ready to take any advantage to cut him off. And
accordingly he gives no other interpretation of all the ways of God but
such as make them look like tokens of final rejection of those that are
concerned in them. If there be upon them outward afflictions, he
tells them these are but the forerunners of hell; if they lie under
inward sense of wrath, he calls that the first-fruits of everlasting
vengeance; if any particular threatening be impressed upon their
consciences by the Spirit of God, in order to their humiliation and
repentance, he represents it as God’s final sentence and absolute
determination against them. If for caution God see it fit to set before
them the examples of his wrath, as it is very frequent for him to do,
lest we ‘should fall after the same example of unbelief,’ 1 Pet. ii. 6;
1 Cor. x. 6, Satan perverts this to that which God never intended, for
he boldly asserts that these examples prognosticate their misery, and
that God signifies by them a prediction of certain unavoidable unhappiness.</p>

<p>This must be observed here, that these misrepresentations of God
are none of Satan’s primary arguments; he useth them only as fresh
reserves to second others. For where he finds any wing of his battalions
ready to be beaten, he comes up with these supplies to relieve
them. For indeed these considerations of God’s severity in the
general, or of his special resolve against any in particular, are not of
force sufficient to attack a soul that is within the trenches of present
peace; they are not of themselves proper mediums to produce such a
conclusion. Though we suppose God severe, except we should imagine
him to be a hater of mankind universally, we cannot thence infer the
final ruin of this or that individual person. And besides that these
are unjustifiable falsehoods, they cannot make the final damnation of
any one so much as probable till the heart be first weakened in its
hopes by fears or doubtings, raised up in it upon other grounds. Then
indeed men are staggered, either by the deep sense of their unworthiness,
or some sad continuing calamity, and the seeming neglect of
their prayers. If Satan then tell them of God’s severity, or that, all
his providences considered, he hath set them up as a ‘mark for the
arrows of his indignation,’ they are ready to believe his report, it being
so suitable to their present sense and feeling.</p>

<p>[3.] Satan also fetcheth arguments from <i>the sins of God’s children,
but his great art in this is by unjust aggravations to make them look
like those offences which by special exception in Scripture are excluded
from pardon</i>. The apostle, 1 John v. 16, tells us of a ‘sin that is
unto death;’ that is, a sin which, if a man commits, he cannot escape
eternal death, and therefore he would not have such a sinner prayed
for. That the popish distinction of venial and mortal sins is not here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
intended, some of the papists themselves do confess.<a id="FNanchor_357_357" href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> What he means
by that sin he doth not tell us, it being a thing known sufficiently
from other scriptures. The note of unpardonableness is indeed affixed
to sins under several denominations; the sin against the Holy Ghost
Christ pronounceth unpardonable, Mat. xii. 31. Total apostasy from
the truth of the gospel hath no less said of it by the apostle when he
calls it ‘a drawing back to perdition,’ Heb. x. 39. Whether these
be all one, or whether there is any other species of sin irremissible
besides that against the Holy Ghost, it is not to our purpose to make
inquiry. Whatever they are in themselves, Satan in this matter
makes use of the texts that speak of them distinctly, as we shall
presently see. But, besides these, the Scriptures speak of some that
were ‘given up to vile affections, and to a reprobate mind,’ Rom. i.
26, 28. And of others that were given up ‘to hardness of heart,’
Mat. xiii. 14; Acts xxviii. 26. Now whosoever they are of whom
these things may be justly affirmed, they are certainly miserable, hopeless
wretches. Here then is Satan’s cunning, if he can make any
child of God believe that he hath done any such act, or acts of sin, as
may bring him within the compass of these scriptures, then he insults
over them, and tells them over and over again that they are cut
off for ever.</p>

<p>To this purpose he aggravates all their sins. And,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, If he find them guilty of <i>any great iniquity, he fixeth upon
that, and labours all he can to make it look most desperately, that so
he may call it the sin against the Holy Ghost</i>; and in this he hath a
mighty advantage, that most men are in the dark about that sin, all
men being not yet agreed whether it be a distinct species of sin, or a
higher degree of wilfulness relating to any particular sin. Upon this
score Satan can lay the charge of this sin upon those that apostatize
from the truth, and through weakness have recanted it. Thus he dealt
with Spira, with Bilney, with Bainham, and several others. There is
so near a resemblance in these sins of denying truths to what is said
of the unpardonable sin, that these men, though they were scholars
and men of good abilities, yet they were not able to answer the argument
that the devil urged against them, but it prevailed to distress
them. Upon others also hath Satan the advantage to fix this accusation;
for let the species of the sin be what it will, if they have anything
of that notion, that the sin against the Holy Ghost is a presumptuous
act of sin under temptation, they will call any notorious
crime the sin against the Holy Ghost, because of the more remarkable
aggravating circumstances that have accompanied such a fact.</p>

<p><i>Second, He aggravates the sins of God’s children from the wilfulness
of their sinning.</i> It is a thing often too true that a child of God
may be carried by a violent impetus, or strong inclination of affection,
to some particular iniquity, where the forwardness of desires that
way, by a sudden haste, do stifle those reluctancies of mind which
may be expected from one endowed with the Spirit of God, whose
power upon them doth ordinarily sway them ‘to lust against the
flesh.’ But it is more ordinary to find a temptation to prevail,
notwithstanding that an enlightened mind doth make some resist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>ance;
which, because it is too feeble, is easily borne down by the
strong importunities of Satan, working upon the inclinations of
the flesh. Both these cases are improved against them over whom
Satan hath got any advantage of doubting of their estate. If they
have resisted but ineffectually, or not resisted at all, he chargeth them
with the highest wilfulness, and will so aggravate the matter that they
shall be put in fear, not only that there can be no grace—where sin
hath so much power as either to control so much light and endeavours,
or hath so subjected the heart to its dominion that it can command
without a contradiction—but that they can have no hope; that
they that sin with so high a hand should ever enter into God’s rest.
And to this purpose he commonly sets before them that text of Heb.
x. 26, ‘If we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.’ Or that of
Heb. vi. 4, ‘It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, ...
if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance.’ Both which
places speak indeed, at least, such a difficulty as in common use of
speech is called an impossibility, if not an utter absolute impossibility,
of repentance and pardon. But then the sinning wilfully or falling
away there mentioned, is only that of total apostasy; when men that
have embraced the gospel, and by it have met with such impressions
of power and delight upon their hearts, which we usually call common
grace, do notwithstanding reject that gospel as false and fabulous, and
so rise up against it with scorn and utmost contempt, as Julian the
apostate did. If now the true intendment of those scriptures were
considered by those that are distressed with them, they might presently
see that they were put into fear, where no such cause of fear was.
But all men have not this knowledge, nor do they so duly attend to
the matter of the apostle’s discourse as to be able to put a right interpretation
upon it. Upon such Satan imposeth his deceitful gloss, and
tells them: Wilful sinners cannot be restored to repentance; but you
have sinned wilfully; when sin was before you, you rushed into it
without any consideration, as the horse into the battle; or when God
stood in your way with commands and advice to the contrary, when
your consciences warned you not to do so great wickedness, yet you
would do it. You were as those that break the yoke and burst the
bonds. Upon this supposition, that these texts speak of wilful sinning
in the general, how little can be said against Satan’s argument! How
many have I known that have been tortured with these texts, judging
their estate fearful, because of their wilfulness in sinning! who upon
the breaking of the snare of Satan’s misrepresentation, have escaped
as a bird unto the hill.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, When either of the two former ways will not serve the turn—that
is, when he meets with such against whom he hath nothing of
notorious wickedness to object, or such as have a better discerning of
Scripture than so to be imposed upon—he labours <i>to make a charge
against them, from the number of their miscarriages</i>. Here he takes
up all the filth he can, and lays it upon one heap at their door. It is
indeed an easy thing for Satan to set the sins of a child of God in order
before him, and to bring to mind innumerable evils, especially to one
that is already awakened with a true discovery of the corruption of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
nature and the vileness of sin. In which case the more a man considers,
the more he will discover; and sins thus set in battle array,
though they be not more than ordinary heinous, yet being many, have
a very dismal appearance. Satan’s design in this is to bring men
under the affrightments which seem most proper to be raised from a
perverse aspect of the third rank of scriptures, which a little before I
pointed at. For the word of God, speaking of the final estate of
men, doth not only discover the hopeless condition of some as to eternal
life from some particular acts of sin, but also the sad estate of others
from the manner, degrees, and frequency of sinning. The heathens,
because they improved not the knowledge of God, which they had
from the works of creation, neither making those inferences in matters
relating to his worship, which those discoveries did direct them unto,
nor behaving themselves in full compliance to those rules of virtuous
conversation which they might have drawn from these principles, and
unto which in point of gratitude they were obliged: Rom. i. 21, ‘They
glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; therefore God gave
them to a reprobate mind.’ And generally, concerning all others, the
Scripture teacheth us that a return to a profane fleshly life, after some
reformation, hath a greater hazard in it than ordinary, as appears by
the parable in Mat. xii. 45, ‘Seven more wicked spirits re-enter;’
where one that was cast out is received again; and ‘the last state of
that man is worse than the first.’ So also 2 Pet. ii. 20. To this purpose
is that of Solomon concerning the danger of continuance in sin,
after many reproofs: Prov. xxix. 1, ‘He that being often reproved
hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without
remedy.’ These, and many such like scriptures, Satan hath in readiness,
which he plies home upon the consciences of those that are
troubled with the sense of sin; telling them that their hearts and ways
being continually evil, notwithstanding all the courses that God hath
taken to reclaim them; that they having so long neglected so great
salvation, or that after having seemed to entertain it, became more
sinful than before—which they will easily believe, because they are
now more sensible of sin, and more observant of their miscarriages
than formerly—there can be no question but they are given up to vile
affections; and like the ground that bears nothing but ‘briars and
thorns, they are rejected, and nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be
burned,’ [Heb. vi. 8.] The wound that is made with this weapon is
not so easily healed as some others already mentioned; because though
Satan do unduly wrest these passages to such failures in the children
of God as have little or no affinity with them, for they only speak of
falling into open profaneness with contumacy, yet they that have deep
convictions, accompanied with great fears, do usually think that there
are none worse than they are. And though they will grant that some
others have more flagitious lives, yet they think they have hearts so
desperately wicked, that they must needs be under as great hazards as
those whose lives seem to be worse.</p>

<p>[4.] There is but one argument more that carries any probability
of proof for everlasting condemnation, and that is from <i>a hard and
impenitent heart</i>. How Satan will manage himself to make a child of
God believe that he hath such a heart, is our last observation relating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
to his sophistry. And it is this: he unjustly aggravates the discomposures
of the spirits of those that are troubled for sin, and from thence
draws his arguments of irrecoverable damnation, pleading that their
hearts are seared, hardened, uncapable of repentance, and consequently
of heaven. That final impenitency will conclude damnation is certain;
and that some have been given up to such a judicial hardness long before
death, that they could not repent, may not only be evidenced from
the threatening of God to that purpose, Mat. xiii. 15, ‘Make the heart
of this people fat,’ &amp;c., but also from the sad instances of Pharaoh, of
whom it is said, that ‘God hardened his heart;’ and the Jews who
were blinded, Rom. xi. 8, ‘God hath given them the spirit of slumber,
eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear.’
But still the art lieth in this, How to make a child of God believe
that it is so with him. For this purpose he must take him at some
advantage, he cannot terrify him with this argument at all times.
While he is acting repentance with an undisturbed settled frame of
heart, it is not possible to make him believe he doth not, or cannot
repent; for this were to force him contrary to sense and experience.
But he must take him at some season which may, with some probability,
admit of his plea, and nothing is more proper for that design
than a troubled heart; so that he hath in this case two things to do:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, He disquiets the soul into as great a height of confusion as
he can. That, <i>second</i>, when he hath melted it into heaviness, and
torn it into pieces, he may work upon its distractions.</p>

<p>There are many things that fall out in the case of great anxiety of
mind, that are capable of improvement for the accomplishment of this
design. As, 1. <i>Distracting troubles bring the heart under the stupidity
of amazement.</i> Their thoughts are so broken and disjointed, that they
cannot unite them to a composed, settled resolution in anything;
they can scarce join them together to make out so much as might
spell out their distinct desires or endeavours; they scarce know what
they are doing, or what they would do. 2. <i>They also poison the
thoughts with harsh apprehensions against God.</i> Great distresses
make the thoughts sometimes recoil against the holy Lord with unseemly
questionings of his goodness and compassion; and this puts
men into a bad sullen humour of untowardness, from whence, through
Satan’s improvement, arise the greatest plunges of despair. 3. Most
usually in this case <i>the greatest endeavours are fruitless and dissatisfactory</i>.
Satan, though he be no friend to duty, doth unseasonably
urge them to repent and pray; but it is because they cannot do either
with any satisfaction, and then their failures are matter of argument
against them. For if they resolve to put themselves upon a more
severe course of repentance, and accordingly begin to think of their
sins, to number them, or to aggravate them, they are usually affrighted
from the undertaking by the heinous appearance of them. They cannot,
they dare not think of them; the remotest glimpse of them is
terrible to an affrighted conscience; the raising of them up again in the
memory, like the rising of a ghost from the grave, is far more astonishing
than the first prospect of them after commission. So true is that
of Luther, ‘If a man could see sin perfectly, it would be a perfect
hell.’ If they set themselves to beg their pardon by earnest prayer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
they are so distracted and confused in prayer, that their prayers please
them not; they come off from the duty more wounded than when
they began. Or if in any measure they overcome these difficulties, so
that they do pray and confess their iniquities, then they urge and
force a sorrow or compunction upon themselves, but still to a greater
dissatisfaction. For it may be—and this usually happens in greater
distresses—they cannot weep, nor force a tear, or if they do, still they
judge their sorrow is not deep enough, nor any way suitable to the
greatness of their sin. 4. To all these Satan sometimes makes a further
addition of trouble, <i>by injecting blasphemous thoughts</i>. Here he
sets the stock, with an intention to graft upon it afterward. When
all these things are thus in readiness, then comes he to set fire to the
train, and thus he endeavours to blow up the mine. Is not thy heart
hardened to everlasting destruction? How canst thou deny this?
Art thou not grown stupid, and senseless of all the hazards that are
before thee? Here he insists upon the amazement and confusion of
their spirit; and it is very natural for those that are drunk with the
terrors of the Almighty, to think themselves stupid, because of the
distraction of their thoughts. I have known several that have pleaded
that very argument to that purpose. Satan goes on: What greater
evidence can there be of a hardened heart than impenitency? Thou
canst not mourn enough. Thou hast not a tear for thy sins, though
thou couldst weep enough formerly upon every petty occasion; nay,
thou canst not so much as pray for pardon. Is not this not only
a heart that doth not, but that cannot repent? Besides, saith he,
thou knowest the secret thoughts that thy heart is privy to; do they
not boil up in thy breast against God? Art thou not ready to tax
him for dealing thus with thee? What is this untowardness, but
desperate obdurateness? And if with all these there be blasphemous
injections, then he tells him it is a clear case that he is judicially
hardened; in that he acts the part of the damned in hell already.
By all, or some of these deceits, the devil doth often prevail so far
with men, that they conclude their heart to be so obstinate, so stupid,
that it is impossible that it should be ever mollified or brought into a
penitential frame, and consequently that there is no hope of their salvation.</p>

<p>(3.) There is but one thing more, besides the occasions which he
takes, and the arguments which he makes use of, relating to Satan’s
method for the procurement of spiritual distresses, and that is his
endeavour to strengthen these arguments by the <i>increase of fears in
their hearts</i>.</p>

<p>What Satan can do in raising up misgiving, tormenting fears, hath
been said; and how serviceable this is to his design, I shall shew in a
few particulars, having only first noted this in the general, that as his
design in these distresses is raised to express his utmost height of
malice against men—in pushing them forward to the greatest mischief,
by excluding them totally from the lowest degree of the hope of happiness,
and by persuading them of the inevitable certainty of their
eternal misery—so he doth endeavour, by the strongest impressions of
fear, to terrify them to the utmost degree of affrightful amazement,
and consequently the effects of that fear are most powerful; for,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>[1.] By this means <i>the spirits of men are formed and moulded into
a frame most suitable for the belief and entertainment of the most dismal
impressions that Satan can put upon them</i>. For strong fears, like
fire, do assimilate everything to their own nature, making them
naturally incline to receive the blackest, the most disadvantageous interpretations
of all things against themselves, so that they have no
capacity to put any other sense upon what lies in their way, but the
very worst. Hence are they possessed with no other thoughts but
that they are remediless wretches, desperate miscreants, utterly forsaken
of God. They are brought into such a woeful partiality against
their own peace, that they cannot judge aright of any accusation, plea,
or argument that Satan brings for a proof of their unhappiness; but
being filled with strong prejudices of hell, they think every sophism a
strong argument, every supposition a truth, and every accusation conclusive
of no less than their eternal damnation; insomuch that their
fears do more to discomfit them than all Satan’s forces. ‘A dreadful
sound being in their ears,’ [Job xv. 21,] their strength fails them at
the appearance of any opposition; as when fear comes upon an army
they throw away their weapons, and, by an easy victory, give their
backs sometimes to an inconsiderable enemy.</p>

<p>[2.] Men thus possessed with fear do not only receive into their own
bowels every weapon which Satan directs on purpose to the wounding
and slaying of their hopes, but by a strange kind of belief <i>they imagine
everything to be the sword of an enemy</i>. All they hear or meet with
turns into poison to them, for they think everything is against them—promises
as well as threatenings, mercies as well as judgments, and
that by all these, one as well as another, God, as with a flaming sword
turning every way, doth hinder their access to the tree of life. Bilney
the martyr, as Latimer in his sermons reports of him, after his denial
of the truth, was under such horrors of conscience, that his friends were
forced to stay with him night and day. No comforts would serve.
If any comfortable place of Scripture was offered to him, it was as if a
man should cut him through with a sword. Nothing did him good;
he thought that all scriptures made against him, and sounded to his
condemnation. Neither is it so rare a thing for fears to form the imagination
into such misshapen apprehensions, as that we should think
such instances to be only singular and unusual; but it is a common
effect of terror, which few or none escape that are under spiritual distresses.
The blackness of their thoughts make the whole Scripture
seem black to them. The unfit medium through which they look
doth discolour every object. So that the book of life, as Mrs Kath.
Bretterge in the like case expressed herself concerning the Bible, seems
to be nothing else but a book of death to them.<a id="FNanchor_358_358" href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></p>

<p>[3.] From hence it follows <i>that no counsel or advice can take place
with them</i>. Excessive fears do remove their souls so far from peace,
that they will not believe there is any hope for them, though it be told
them. The most compassionate, serious admonitions of friends, the
strongest arguments against despair, the clearest discoveries of the
hopes that are before them, &amp;c., effect but little. While they are
spoken, it may be, they seem to relieve them a little; but the comfort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
abides not with them, it is soon gone. Though they cannot answer
the arguments brought for them, yet they cannot believe them; as if
their souls were now deprived of all power to believe anything for their
good: suitable to that expression of Spira, in answer to his friends
that laboured to comfort him, ‘I would believe comfort, but cannot;
I can believe nothing but what is contrary to my comfort,’ Nay,
when they are told that many others have been under the like dreadful
apprehensions of everlasting misery who have at last been comforted—and
by manifold experience we find that it is the greatest ease
to distressed souls to hear, especially to speak with some that have
been in the like case, for this will oft administer some hope that they
also may be at last comforted, when the most comfortable promises of
the Scripture are a terror to them;—yet this doth [not] effect the least
ease for them sometimes, because some are so wholly possessed with
unalterable prejudice against themselves, that they think none are or
ever were like them. They compare themselves to Judas and Cain,
and think their iniquity to be aggravated by many circumstances far
beyond the pitch of them. Thus Spira judged of himself: ‘I tell you,’
saith he, ‘my case is mine own, it is singular, none like it.’</p>

<p>[4.] Though fears make the soul unactive to anything of comfort,
because they wholly destroy its inclination and alter its bias to hope,
yet, on the contrary, <i>they make it very nimble and active to pursue the
conclusions of misery which they have helped to frame</i>, for the spring
of all the faculties of the soul are bent that way. Hence it is that those
who are possessed with these agonies will eagerly plead against themselves,
and with an admirable subtlety will frame arguments against
their peace, coin distinctions, and make strange evasions to escape the
force of any consolation that may be offered to them. Their understandings
are, as it were, whetted by their fears to an unimaginable
quickness. Who would not wonder to hear the replies that some will
give to the arguings of their friends that labour to comfort them!
What strange answers Spira gave to those that pleaded with him!
How easily he seemed to turn off the example of Peter denying Christ,
and those scriptures that speak of God’s love to mankind, &amp;c., may be
seen at large in his narrative.</p>

<p>[5.] Fears by a strange kind of witchcraft do not only make them
believe that they shall be unhappy, but also will at last persuade them
<i>that they feel and see their misery already</i>. How astonishingly doth
Spira speak to this purpose: ‘I find he daily more and more hardens
me; I feel it.’ Answerable to this, I remember, was the case of one
who was long imprisoned in deep distresses. He told me that he verily
believed that scripture of Isa. lxvi. 23, 24 was fulfilled upon him, ‘From
one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me, and
they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have
transgressed against me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall
their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.’
To his own feeling he had the torments of conscience, and the sense
of divine wrath was as a burning fire within him, and to his apprehension
every look from others was a gazing upon him as a monster
of misery, ‘abhorred of all flesh.’</p>

<p>The nature of spiritual distresses, and Satan’s method in working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
them, being explained, the last thing promised is now to be opened.
This is,</p>

<p>3. The burden and weight of these distresses, which how grievous,
how intolerable it is, may be sufficiently seen in what hath been
already said, and may be further evidenced in the particulars following:—</p>

<p>[1.] <i>Those that are wounded with these fiery darts do at first usually
conceal their wound and smother their grief, being ashamed to declare
it</i>, partly because some great transgression, it may be, hath kindled
all this fire in their bosoms, and this they are unwilling to declare to
others; partly because they suspect—though no one remarkable sin
hath occasioned these troubles—that the discovery of their case will
expose them to the wonder and censures of all that shall hear of them.
By this means the fire burns with greater vehemency. Their sore
runs continually, and having none to speak a word in season for the
least relief, it becomes more painful and dangerous; as bodily distempers,
concealed by a foolish modesty from the physician, increase the
trouble and hazard of the patient. Here have they many strugglings
within themselves, many attempts to overcome their fears, but all in
vain. They sit alone and keep silence, they flee the company and
society of men, they labour after solitary places where they may weep
with freedom, if their tears be not yet dried up, or at least where they
may pour out their complaints against themselves. They meditate
nothing but their misery, they can fix their thoughts upon nothing
else, they ‘chatter as a crane or swallow, they mourn as a dove,’ they
are as ‘a pelican in the wilderness, as an owl in the desert,’ but still
without ease. They are but as those that are ‘snared in dens and
prison-houses,’ who the longer they lie there have the less patience
to bear the present unhappiness, and the less hope to be delivered
from it.</p>

<p>[2.] <i>When they are tired out with private conflicts, and have no
rest or intermission of trouble, then at last they are forced to speak;
and having once begun to open their troubles, they care not who knows
it.</i> If there be any heinous sin at the bottom, their consciences are
forced to confess it. Wickedness, that was once sweet in his mouth,
‘is turned in his bowels, it is the gall of asps within him,’ Job xx.
14, 15. Thus doth God make men to vomit up what they had swallowed
down. Terrors chase away all shame, they can now freely speak
against their sin with the highest aggravations. And if their consciences
have not a heinous crime to accuse them of in particular, yet
in the general they will judge and condemn themselves as the most
stubborn, sinful, or hardened wretches, justly branded with indelible
characters of the wrath of God. However, the distress becomes
greater; if they truly accuse themselves of any particular sin, that
vomit is not without a violence offered to nature which otherwise
would cover its shame. It cannot be done without sickness, straining,
and torture; and when it is done, they take it for granted that every
one passeth the same judgment upon them which they do upon themselves;
and the frequent speaking doth confirm their minds in their
fearful expectations. For what men do accustom themselves to assert,
that they do more confidently believe. If they only complain of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>selves
in the general, with any intentions of procurement of pity, as is
usual for the distressed to do, yet while they cry out to others, ‘Is this
nothing to you, all you that pass by? Is there any sorrow like to my
sorrow?’ &amp;c., [Lam. i. 12,] still they think their ‘stroke is heavier than
their groaning,’ [Job xxiii. 2;] and their cry to others doth strongly
fix this apprehension in themselves, that none can be more miserable
than they. Thus are they brought to Job’s condition: chap. xvi. 6,
‘Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; and though I forbear,
what am I eased?’</p>

<p>[3.] All this while they are under <i>an expressible<a id="FNanchor_359_359" href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> sense of divine
wrath</i>. Heman speaks his apprehensions of it under the similitude of
the most hideous and dismal comfortless imprisonment: Ps. lxxxviii. 6,
‘Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.’ David,
in Ps. cxvi. 3, compares it to the ‘sorrows of death,’ and—the highest
that human thoughts can reach—‘the pains of hell.’ ‘The sorrows of
death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me; I found
trouble and sorrow.’ Well might they thus judge, all things considered;
for sin, that then lies heavy upon them, is a great weight, ‘a
burden,’ saith David, ‘greater than I can bear,’ especially when it is
pressed on by a heavy hand: ‘Thy hand presseth me sore.’ Sin
makes the greatest wound, considering the conscience, which is
wounded by it, is the tenderest part, and of exquisite sense. Hence
the grief of it is compared to the pain of a running, fretting ulcer, that
distempers the whole body: ‘My wounds stink and are corrupted; my
sore ran in the night, and ceased not.’ Or to the pain of broken and
shattered bones: Ps. xxxviii. 3, ‘There is no soundness in my flesh,
because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones, because
of my sin.’ The instrument also that makes the wound is sharp, and
cuts deep: ‘It is sharper than a two-edged sword,’ [Heb. iv. 12;] but
when the weapon is poisoned,—and Satan hath a way to do that,—then
it burns, making painful, malignant inflammations. The wrath of
God, expressed to the conscience, brings the greatest terror: ‘Who
knows the power of thine anger?’ Ps. xc. 11. It is impossible for
the most trembling conscience, or most jealous fears, to go to the
utmost bounds of it; neither can we apprehend any torture greater.
The rack, tortures, fire, gibbets, &amp;c., are all nothing to it. Hence it
is that those who were afraid of suffering for truth, when by this
means they were brought under these distresses, could then be willing
to suffer any torment on the body; yea, and heartily wish to suffer
much more, so that these tortures might be ended. Thus it was with
Bainham martyr,<a id="FNanchor_360_360" href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> who, in the public congregation, bewailed his abjuration
of the truth; and prayed all his hearers ‘rather to die by and
by, than do as he had done.’ But that of Spira seems almost beyond
belief. Thus speaks he to Vergerius, ‘If I could conceive but the least
spark of hope of a better estate hereafter, I would not refuse to endure
the most heavy weight of the wrath of that great God, yea, for twenty
thousand years, so that I might at length attain to the end of that
misery.’ What dreadful agonies were these that put him to these
wishes! But it is less wonder, if you observe what apprehensions he
had of his present trouble, he judged it worse than hell itself. And if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
you would have a lively exposition of David’s expression, ‘The pains
of hell,’ &amp;c., you may fetch it from this instance: ‘My present estate,’
saith he, ‘I now account worse than if my soul, separated from my
body, were with Judas and the rest of the damned; and therefore I
desire rather to be there than thus to live in the body.’ So that if you
imagine a man crushed under the greatest weight, wounded in the
most tender parts, and those wounds provoked by the sharpest corrosives,
his bones all disjointed and broken, pined also with hunger and
thirst, and in that case put under the highest tortures; yet you have
but a very shadow of divine wrath. Add to all these, according to
Spira’s wish, twenty thousand years of hell itself, yet all is nothing to
that which a distressed mind supposeth; while the word <i>eternity</i> presents
the soul with the total sum of utmost misery all at once. Oh,
unexpressible burden of a distressed mind! who can understand it truly,
but he that feels it? How terribly is the mind of man shaken with
terrors, as the wilderness by a mighty wind! which not only produceth
violent motions, but also hideous noise, murmur, and howling.</p>

<p>[4.] This burden upon the mind <i>forceth the tongue to vent its sorrow
in the saddest accent of most doleful outcries</i>. Their whole language
is lamentation; but when the pangs of their agonies come upon them,
for their distresses have their fits, then they speak in the bitterness of
their souls. Oh, said Bainham, I would not for all the world’s good
feel such a hell in my conscience again. One, formerly mentioned, in
these distresses cries out, ‘Woe, woe, woe, a woeful, a wretched, a forsaken
woman!’<a id="FNanchor_361_361" href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> It would surely have made a man’s hair to stand
upright for dread to have heard Spira roaring out that terrible sentence,
‘How dreadful is it to fall into the hands of the living God!’ [Heb.
x. 31.] Or to have heard his reply to him that told of his being at
Venice: ‘O cursed day!’ saith he, ‘O cursed day! Oh that I had
never gone thither, would God I had then died!’ &amp;c. The like outcries
had David often: Ps. xxi. 1, ‘My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me? Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the
words of my roaring?’ And Heman, Ps. lxxxviii. 14, ‘Lord, why
castest thou off my soul, why hidest thou thy face from me?’ It is
true David’s and Heman’s words have a better complexion than those
others last mentioned; but their disquiet of heart seems, at some
times, to have urged their expressions with impetuous violence; as
those passages seem to say, Ps. xxxviii. 8, ‘I have roared by reason
of the disquietness of my heart;’ Ps. xxxii. 3, ‘My bones waxed old
through my roaring all the day long;’ Job iii. 24, ‘My roarings are
poured out like water,’ If their lamentations were turned into roarings,
and those roarings were like the breaking in of a flood, and that
flood of so long continuance that it dried up the marrow of the bones,
we may safely imagine that they were not so much at leisure to order
their words, but that their tongues might speak in that dialect which is
proper to astonishment and distress.</p>

<p>[5.] Though the mind be the principal seat of these troubles, <i>yet
the body cannot be exempted from a co-partnership in these sorrows</i>.
Notwithstanding, this is so far from abating the trouble, that it
increaseth it by a circulation. The pains of the body, contracted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
the trouble of the mind, are communicated again to the fountain from
whence they came, and reciprocally augment the disquiet of the mind.
The body is weakened, their ‘strength poured out like water;’ they
are ‘withered like grass,’ pined as ‘a skin,’ become as a ‘bottle in
the smoke.’ Thus David frequently complains: Ps. xxii. 14, he
describes himself as reduced to a skeleton, ‘I am poured out like
water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is
melted in the midst of my bowels. My strength is dried up like a
potsherd; my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me
to the dust of death.’ Neither is this his peculiar case, but the
common effect of spiritual distresses: Ps. xxxix. 11, ‘When thou
with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to
consume away like a moth.’</p>

<p>[6.] Being thus distressed for their souls, they cast off <i>all care
of their bodies, estates, families, and all their outward concerns whatsoever</i>.
And no wonder, for being persuaded that they have made
shipwreck of their souls, they judge the rest are not worth the
saving.</p>

<p>[7.] Giving all for lost, they usually cast about for some ease to
their minds, <i>by seeking after the lower degrees of misery, hearing or
supposing that all are not tormented alike, they endeavour to persuade
themselves of a cooler hell</i>. This, if they could reach it, were but poor
comfort, and little to their satisfaction; but, as poor as it is, it is
usually denied to them, for while they judge themselves to be the
greatest sinners, they cannot but adjudge themselves to the greatest
torments; and these endeavours being frustrated, they return back to
themselves, as now hopeless of the least case, worse than before. Now
they fix themselves upon the deep contemplations of their misery. Oh,
think they, how great had our happiness been if we had been made
toads, serpents, worms, or anything but men; for then should we
never have known this unhappiness; and this begets a thousand vain
wishes. Oh that we had never been born! or that death could
annihilate us! or that as soon as we had been born, we had died! as
Job speaks: chap. iii. 11, 12, ‘Why died I not from the womb? why
did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?’ for then
had we not contracted so much guilt. ‘Or that the mountains and
hills could fall upon us, and cover us from the face of our judge,’
[Rev. vi. 16.]</p>

<p>[8.] When all their hopes are thus dashed, and, like a shipwrecked
man on a plank, they are still knocked down with new waves, all
their endeavours being still frustrated, they seem to themselves to be
able to hold out no longer; then they <i>give over all further inquiries,
and the use of means, they refuse to pray, read, hear</i>. They perceive,
as Spira said, that they pray to their own condemnation, and that all
is to no purpose. They are ‘weary of their groanings,’ Ps. vi. 6; their
‘eyes fail with looking up;’ their ‘knees are feeble;’ their hands
hang down; and as Heman: Ps. lxxxviii. 4, 5, ‘They count themselves
with those that go down to the pit, free among the dead, like
the slain that lie in the grave, whom God remembereth no more.’
Thus they lie down under their burden, and while they find it so hard
to be borne, it is usual for them to come to the utmost point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
desperateness, Satan suggesting and forwarding them. Sometimes
they open their mouths with complaints against God, and blaspheme.
And, as the last part of the tragedy, being weary of themselves,
they seek to put an end to their present misery, by putting an end to
their lives.</p>

<p>I have presented you with Satan’s stratagems against the peace of
God’s children. The remedies against these and other subtleties of
our grand enemy I shall not offer you, because many others have
done that already, to whose writings I must refer you. Some principal
directions I have pointed at in the way, and in the general, have done
this for the help of the tempted, that I have endeavoured to shew
them the methods of [the] tempter, which is no small help to preserve men
from being thus imposed upon, and to recover out of his snare those
that are. It is a great preservative from sickness, and no mean advantage
to the cure, to have a discovery of the disease, and the causes of
it. I shall conclude these discoveries with a caution or two.</p>

<p>[1.] <i>Let none think worse of the serious practice of holy strictness in
religion, because these spiritual distresses do sometimes befall those
that are conscientiously careful in the ways of God, while the profane
and negligent professors are strangers to such trials.</i> These troubles
are indeed very sad, but a senseless, careless state is far worse. These
troubles often end very comfortably, whereas the other end—except
God make them sensible by conviction of their sin and danger—in
that real misery, the fears whereof occasion these sorrows to God’s
children. And the danger of spiritual troubles is not so great as
is that of a hardened heart; nay, God frequently makes use of them
to prevent eternal ruin—for one that goes roaring to the pit, there are
thousands that go laughing to hell.</p>

<p>[2.] <i>Let none slight or scoff at these tremendous judgments.</i> It is
too common with men, either to ascribe spiritual troubles to melancholy,
as if none were ever thus concerned, but such, as by too much
seriousness in religion, are become mad—a fair pretence for carelessness—or
to a whining dissimulation. To the former I have said
something before, and as for the latter I shall only reply, in the words
of Spira, to one that objected hypocrisy to him: ‘I am a castaway, a
vessel of wrath; yet dare you call it dissembling and frenzy, and can
mock at the formidable example of the heavy wrath of God that
should teach you fear and terror. But it is natural to the flesh
to speak, either out of malice or ignorance, perversely of the work of
God,’</p>

<p>[3.] <i>Let none be afraid of this Goliath, let no man’s heart faint
because of him.</i> A fear of caution and diligence to avoid his snares is
a necessary duty—‘Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the
devil,’ &amp;c., [1 Pet. v. 8]—but a discouraging, distrustful fear is a dishonourable
reflection upon God’s power and promises to help us, and
upon the captain of our salvation, who goeth out before us. Let
us hold on in the practice of holiness, and not be afraid. ‘The God
of peace shall tread down Satan under our feet shortly,’ [Rom. xvi.
20.] Amen.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<h3 id="CHAPTER_I_3">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The first circumstance of the combat—The time when it happened—The
two solemn seasons of temptation—The reasons thereof.</i></p>


<p>I shall here consider the great temptation which it pleased our Lord
Christ to submit unto, as a most famous instance for confirmation
and illustration of the doctrine of temptations already handled.</p>

<p>The first verse sets down several remarkable circumstances of this
combat, all of them matter of weight and worth: as,</p>

<p>1. First, <i>The time when this fell out</i>; not as a loose and accidental
emergency, but as particularly made choice of both by God and
Satan, being most fit and proper for the design which each of them
were carrying on. This is expressly noted in Mat. iv. 1, ‘<i>Then</i> was
Jesus led up;’ but more full in Mark i. 12, ‘<i>Immediately</i> the Spirit
driveth him into the wilderness;’ manifestly directing us to expect
something worthy of our observation in that circumstance. Neither
can we miss of it, when the things unto which this directs us are so fully
related immediately before. For we find in both these evangelists,
which speak so exactly of the time of these temptations, that Christ
was baptized of John. This was in order to the fulfilling the righteousness
of his office. As the priests under the law, when they came to
be thirty years old, entered upon their function by washings, or
baptizings and anointings:<a id="FNanchor_362_362" href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> so Christ, that he might answer his type,
beginning to be about thirty years of age, was solemnly inaugurated
into the great office of the mediatorship by baptism, and the extraordinary
descending of the Holy Ghost, by which he was ‘anointed
with the oil of gladness above his fellows.’ To this solemn instalment
the Father adds an honourable testimony concerning him, ‘This is
my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,’ Luke iii. 23. Immediately
after this was he carried to the place of combat. Hence
we may infer,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 1. <i>That our entering upon a special service for God, or re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>ceiving
a special favour from God, are two solemn seasons which
Satan makes use of for temptation.</i> Often these two seasons meet
together in the same person at the same time. Paul, after his rapture
into the third heaven, 2 Cor. xii. 2, 7, which, as some conceive, was
also upon his entrance upon the ministry, was buffeted by ‘the messenger
of Satan.’</p>

<p>Sometime these two seasons are severed; yet still it may be observed
that the devil watcheth them. When any servant of God is to
engage in any particular employment, he will be upon him. He
assaulted Moses by persecution, when he was first called to deliver
Israel. As soon as David was anointed, immediately doth he enrage
the minds of Saul and his courtiers against him. It was so ordinary
with Luther, that he at last came to this, that before any eminent
service he constantly expected either a fit of sickness, or the buffetings
of Satan. He is no less sedulous in giving his assaults when any
child of God hath been under peculiar favours or enjoyments. The
church, after a high entertainment with Christ, is presently overcome
by a careless, sleepy indisposition, Cant. v. 1, 2.</p>

<p>Though this may seem strange, yet the harshness of such a providence
on God’s part, and the boldness of the attempt on Satan’s
part, may be much taken off by the consideration of the reasons
hereof.</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>On Satan’s part</i>. It is no great wonder to see such an
undertaking, when we consider his fury and malice. The more we
receive from God, and the more we are to do for him, the more doth
he malign us. So much the more as God is good, by so much is his
eye evil.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, There are in such cases as these several advantages,
which, through our weakness and imperfection, we are too apt to
give him; and for these he lieth at the catch.</p>

<p>[1.] As first, <i>Security</i>. We are apt to grow proud, careless, and
confident, after or upon such employments and favours; even as men
are apt to sleep or surfeit upon a full meal, or to forget themselves
when they are advanced to honour. Job’s great peace and plenty
made him, as he confesseth, so confident, that he concluded he should
‘die in his nest,’ chap. xxix. 18. David enjoying the favour of God in
a more than ordinary measure, though he was more acquainted with
vicissitudes and changes than most of men, grows secure in his apprehension,
that he ‘should never be moved,’ Ps. xxx. 6; but he acknowledgeth
his mistake, and leaves it upon record as an experience
necessary for others to take warning by, that when he became warm
under the beams of God’s countenance, then he was apt to fall into
security; and—this it seems was usual with him in all such cases—when
he was most secure, he was nearest some trouble or disquiet.
‘Thou didst hide thy face’—and then to be sure the devil will shew
his—‘and I was troubled.’ Enjoyments beget confidence; confidence
brings forth carelessness; carelessness makes God withdraw, and gives
opportunity to Satan to work unseen. And thus, as armies after
victory growing secure, are oft surprised; so are we oft after our
spiritual advancements thrown down.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Discouragement and tergiversation</i> is another thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
the devil watcheth for. By his assaults he represents the duty difficult,
tedious, dangerous, or impossible, on purpose to discourage us,
and to make us fall back. No sooner doth Paul engage in the gospel
than the devil is upon him, suggesting such hazards as he knew were
most prevalent with our frail natures, if he had not been aware of
him, and refused to hearken to what flesh and blood would have said
in the case, Gal. i. 16. When God honoured Moses with the high
employment of delivering Israel, the hazard and danger of the work
was so strongly fixed upon his thoughts, that he makes many excuses:
one while pleading his inability and insufficiency, ‘Who am I, that I
should go to Pharaoh?’ Exod. iii. 11. Another while he urgeth
Israel’s unbelief, and a seeming impossibility to satisfy them of his
commission, Exod. iv. 1. After that he deviseth another shift, ‘I am
not eloquent,’ ver. 10. And when all these subterfuges were removed,
Satan had so affrighted him with the trouble and difficulty of this
undertaking, that he attempts to break away from his duty: ver. 13,
‘Send by the hand of him whom thou wilt send;’ that is, spare me
and send another: and till the anger and displeasure of God was
manifested against him, he submitted not. In Jonah the temptation
went higher. He, upon the apprehensions mentioned, ran away from
his service, and puts God to convince him by an extraordinary punishment.
And when Satan prevails not so far as wholly to deter men by
such onsets, yet, at least, he doth dishearten and discourage them,
so that the work loseth much of that glory, excellency, and exactness,
which a ready and cheerful undertaking would put upon it.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>The fall or miscarriage of the saints at such times is
of more than ordinary disadvantage</i>, not only to others—for if they
can be prevailed with to lay aside their work, or to neglect the improvement
of their favours, others are deprived of the benefit and help
that might be expected from them—but also to themselves. A prevailing
temptation doth more than ordinarily prejudice them at such
times. The greatness of the disappointment under special service, the
unworthy neglect and unanswerableness to special favours, are extraordinary
provocations, and produce more than ordinary chastisements,
as we see in Jonah’s affliction, and the spouse’s desertion.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, As we have seen the reason of Satan’s keenness in
taking those opportunities, so may we consider the reasons of <i>God’s
permission</i>, which are these:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, Temptations at such seasons are permitted for more
eminent <i>trial of the upright</i>. On this account was Job tempted.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>For an increase of diligence, humility, and watchfulness</i>.
If these privileges and mercies will not discourage Satan,
what will? And if Satan so openly malign such enjoyments, we may
be awakened to hold them faster and set a double guard upon them.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>For a plentiful furniture of experience</i>. Temptation
is the shop of experience. Luther was so great a gainer by this, that
he became able so to speak to the consciences and conditions of his
hearers, that the thoughts of their hearts were manifested by his speaking,
as if he had had an intelligencer in their own bosoms. Hence did
he commend prayer, meditation, and temptation as necessary requisites
for the accomplishment of a minister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This may administer matter of counsel to us in both cases
aforementioned, if we be put upon eminent employments or receive
eminent favours.</p>

<p>1. First, <i>We must not be so secure as to think Satan will be asleep
that while, or that we are beyond danger</i>. While we are receiving
kindnesses, he is devising plots and laying snares. With privileges
and mercies expect exercises and hazards.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, in particular, <i>We may receive something of advice
from this consideration in reference to both cases</i>.</p>

<p>(1.) If God is about to employ us in any service,</p>

<p>[1.] We have little need to be <i>confident of our abilities or performance</i>,
when we know that temptations wait for us.</p>

<p>[2.] We must not only be sensible of our weakness, that we be not
confident; but we must be <i>apprehensive of the strength and power of
God to carry us through</i>, that we be not discouraged.</p>

<p>[3.] We must see our <i>opposition</i>, that we may be watchful; and
yet must we refuse to give it the least place of consideration in our
debates of duty, lest it sway us against duty or dishearten us in it.</p>

<p>(2.) If God be pleased to honour us with peculiar favours, then,</p>

<p>[1.] Though we must improve them to the full, yet must we not
feed on them without fear.</p>

<p>[2.] We must not stay in the enjoyment or play with the token,
but look to the tendency of such favours and improve them to duty,
as to their proper end.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_II_3">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The second circumstance, Christ’s being led by the Spirit.—What
hand the Spirit of God hath in temptations.—And of running into
temptation when not led into it.</i></p>


<p>2. The second circumstance acquaints <i>how Christ was carried to
the combat</i>. In solemn combats and duels, the persons undertaking
the fight were usually carried to the place with great solemnity and
ceremony. Christ in this spiritual battle is described as having the
conduct of the Spirit, ‘He was led up of the Spirit,’ &amp;c. What this
Spirit was is, though by a needless and over-officious diligence, questioned
by some; but we need not stay much upon it, if we consider the
phrase of the evangelists, who mention <i>Spirit</i> without any note of distinction—which
of necessity must have been added if it had intended
either his proper spirit as man, or the wicked spirit Satan—directing
thereby to understand it of him to whom the word Spirit is more peculiarly
attributed, viz., the Holy Ghost. Or if we observe the close
connexion in Luke betwixt that expression of Christ’s being ‘full of
the Holy Ghost,’ and his being ‘led by the Spirit,’ it will be out of
controversy that the Holy Spirit is here intended. Hence was it that
Beza translates it more fully, ‘Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost,
was led, <i>eodem Spiritu</i>, of the same Spirit;’ and the Syriac, in Matthew,
doubts not to express it by the Holy Spirit. And what else can
be imagined, when in this text the Spirit that led him up, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
devil that tempted, are mentioned in so direct an opposition? ‘He
was led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.’
The manner of his being carried thither is expressed by such words
as signify, though not an external rapture like that of Philip, a strong
inward motion and impulse upon him. The Spirit driveth—ἐκβάλλεν—him,
saith Mark. The Spirit ‘led him’—ἤγετο—saith Luke, using
the same word by which the Scripture elsewhere expresseth the power
of the Spirit upon the children of God, who are said to be ‘led’ by
him.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 2. Hence note <i>that the Spirit of God hath a hand in temptations</i>.
Christ was led by the Spirit to be tempted. This must not
be understood as if God did properly tempt any to sin, either by enticing
their hearts to evil, or by moving and suggesting wicked things
to their minds, or by infusing evil inclinations, or by any proper compliance
with Satan to undermine and delude us by any treachery or
deceit. None of these can be imagined without apparent derogation
to the holiness of God, ‘who tempteth no man, neither can he be
tempted with evil,’ [James i. 13.] But what we are to understand by
the Holy Spirit’s concerning himself in temptations, is included in these
particulars:—</p>

<p>1. First, God gives <i>commission to Satan</i>, without which his hand
would be sealed up under an impossibility of reaching it out against
any.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, <i>Opportunities and occasions do depend upon his providence</i>,
without which nothing comes to pass. Neither we nor anything
else do or can move without him.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, The Spirit <i>oversees the temptation as to measure and
continuance</i>. The length and breadth of it is ordered by him.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, <i>The issue and consequences of every temptation are at
his appointment</i>. The ways of its working for our exercise, humiliation,
or conviction, or for any other good and advantage whatsoever,
they all belong to his determination.</p>

<p>So that it is not improper to assert that God and Satan do concur
in the same temptation, though the ways of proceeding, with the aims
and intentions of both, be directly different and contrary. Hence is
it that the temptation of David, 1 Sam. xxiv. 1, and 1 Chron. xxi. 1,
are upon several regards attributed both to God and Satan.</p>

<p><i>Appl.</i> 1. This note is of use to remove those harsh interpretations
which poor tempted Christians meet withal, commonly from such as
have not touched their burdens with the least of their fingers. Men
are apt in these cases to judge,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>The ways of religion, as being ways, at least in the more
serious and rigid practice of them, of intolerable hazard and perplexity</i>,
and only upon an observation that those who most addict themselves
to a true and strict observance of duty and command usually
complain of temptations, and express sometimes their fears and distress
of heart about them. This is your reading, your praying, and
hearing. Such preaching, say they, leads men to despair and perpetual
disquiet; and upon the whole they conclude it dangerous to be religious
above the common rate of those that prosecute it in a slow and
careless indifferency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, The like severity of censure do they use in reference
to <i>the spiritual state of the tempted</i>, as if they were vessels of his
hatred, and such as were by him given up to the power of this ‘wild
boar of the forest’ to devour and tear. All kind of distresses are
obnoxious to the worst of misjudgings from malevolent minds. The
sufferings of Christ produced this censorious scoff, ‘Let God deliver
him, if he will have him,’ [Mat. xxvii. 43.] David’s troubles easily
induced his adversaries to conclude that ‘God had forsaken him, and
that there was none to deliver him,’ Ps. lxxi. 11. But in troubles of
this nature, where especially there are frightful complainings against
themselves, men are more easily drawn out to be peremptory in their
uncharitable determinations concerning them, because the trouble
itself is somewhat rare, and apt to beget hideous impressions; and
withal the vent which the afflicted parties give by their bemoaning of
their estate, in hope to ease themselves thereby, is but taken as a
testimony against themselves, and the undoubted echoes of their real
feelings.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>Their sins are upon this ground misjudged and
heightened</i>. Unusual troubles with common apprehension argue
unusual sins. The viper upon Paul’s hand made the barbarians
confident he was a man of more than ordinary guilt and wickedness,
Acts xxviii. 4. David’s sickness was enough to give his enemies
occasion to surmise that it was the punishment of some great transgression.
‘An evil disease,’ say they, ‘cleaveth to him,’ Ps. xli. 8.
Those that were overwhelmed by the fall of the tower of Siloam, and
those whose blood Pilate mixed with their sacrifices, were judged
greatest sinners, Luke xiii. 4. But in inward temptations, this
misjudging confidence is every way more heightened; and those
that are most molested are supposed to have given more away to
Satan.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, Temptations are also misjudged <i>to be worse than
they are</i>. They are indeed things to be trembled at; but they are
not properly of an astonishing, amazing, or despairing consideration,
as men are apt to think that view the workings of them at a
distance.</p>

<p>Against all those unrighteous surmises, the poor afflicted servants
of Christ may have relief from this truth in hand, that the Holy
Spirit of God hath a hand in temptations: and therefore it is impossible
that everywhere they should be of such a signification. Were
they in themselves no way serviceable to God’s glory in the gracious
exercise of his children, the Spirit of wisdom and holiness would not
at all have a hand in them. If under Satan’s assaults you meet with
those that by such a harshness of censure would aggravate your
troubles, and so grieve those whom God hath saddened, you may
boldly appeal from them to him that judgeth righteously. And
indeed, if men would but consider, in the saddest case of this nature,
either,</p>

<p>[1.] <i>The end of the Lord in permitting temptations</i>, which, if seen,
would give a high justification of his dealing, and force men to
applaud and magnify his wisdom, rather than to censure it. Or,</p>

<p>[2.] If they could but see the <i>secret ways of God’s support</i>, how he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
acts his part in holding them by the hand, in counterworking of Satan,
and confounding him under the exercise of his highest malice, and
also in the ways of his preservation and deliverance. Or,</p>

<p>[3.] <i>If the harmlessness of temptations, when their sting is taken
out, were but weighed</i>, men would change their minds as readily as the
barbarians did, when they saw the viper not effect that mischief they
supposed upon Paul; and would see cause to stand amazed at the
contrivances of so much power and wisdom, as can turn these to
quite other ends and uses, than what they of themselves seem to
threaten.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> 2. This consideration will further express its usefulness <i>in
comforting us under temptations</i>. It might have been Paul’s great
discouragement, that in his answer before Nero no man stood with
him, 2 Tim. iv. 16; but this was his support, that God was with him.
The like encouragement we have under all assaults of Satan, that we
are not left to ourselves, but the Spirit of God is with us, and that he
concerns himself on a design to oversee and overrule his work, and to
put a check upon him when there is need. So that he cannot tempt
as he will, nor when he will, nor in what he would, nor as long
as he would; but that in all cases, we may rely upon the great
master-contriver, for relief, help, mitigation, or deliverance, as there
is need.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 3. In that the evangelists do not say that Christ cast himself
upon a temptation, neither did go to undertake it till he was led to it,
we note, <i>that whatever may be the advantage of a temptation by the
Spirit’s ordering of it, or what security from danger we may promise
to ourselves upon that account, yet must we not run upon temptations;
though we must submit when we are fairly led into them</i>. The reasons
of this truth are these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, There is so much of <i>the nature of evil in temptations
that they are to be avoided if possible</i>. Good they may accidentally be,
that is, beyond their proper nature and tendency, by the overruling
hand of God; but being in their own natural constitution evil, it is
inconsistent with human nature to desire them as such.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>To run upon them would be a dangerous tempting of
God</i>; that is, making a bold and presumptuous trial, without call,
whether he will put forth his power to rescue us or not. Now he
that runs upon a temptation hath no promise to be delivered out of
it. And besides, runs upon so desperate a provocation, that in all probability
he shall miscarry in it, as a just punishment of his rashness.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But inquiry may be made, When do men run uncalled and
unwarrantably upon temptation? I answer, many ways. As,</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> [1.] First, When men engage themselves <i>in sin and apparent
wickedness, in the works of the flesh</i>. For it can never be imagined
that the holy God should ever by his Spirit call any to such things as
his soul abhors.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, When men run upon <i>the visible and apparent occasions
and causes of sin</i>. This is like a man’s going to the pest-house.
Thus do they, that though they design not to be actors in evil, yet
will give their company and countenance to persons actually engaged
in evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, When men <i>unnecessarily, without the conduct either
of command or urging an unavoidable providence, do put themselves,
though not upon visible and certain opportunities, yet, upon dangerous
and hazardous occasions and snares</i>. Peter had no errand in the
high-priest’s hall; his curiosity led him thither; he might easily have
foreseen a probable snare; but confidently putting himself forward,
where his danger was more than his business, he ran upon the temptation,
and accordingly fell. The like did Dinah, when she made a
needless vagary to see the daughters of the land; where she met
with her sin and shame, Gen. xxxiv. 1. Neither do they otherwise,
who dare adventure themselves in families—whilst yet they are free
and may otherwise dispose of themselves—where they see snares and
temptations will be laid before them. The case indeed is otherwise to
those that are under the necessary engagement of relation, natural or
voluntary, if it be antecedent to the hazard, to live in such places or
callings; they have a greater promise of preservation than others can
lay claim to, Ps. xci. 11; Prov. x. 29.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Those run upon temptation, that adventure <i>apparently
beyond their strength, and put themselves upon actions good or
harmless, disproportionably to their abilities</i>. The apostle gives the
instance in marriage abstinence, 1 Cor. vii. 5, which he cautions may
not be undertaken at a careless adventure for fear of a temptation:
and by this may we judge other things of like nature.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, They are also guilty that design an <i>adventure unto the
utmost bounds of lawful liberty</i>. Those that have a mind to try conclusions,
how near they may make their approaches to sin, and yet
keep off from the defilement, such as would divide a hair betwixt good
and evil, have at best but a hair’s breadth betwixt them and sin; but
how easily are they brought over that. Like a man that walks upon
the utmost verge of a river’s brink, ofttimes meets with hollow ground
and a dangerous slip before he is aware.</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, Those also may be reckoned in the number of such as
rush upon their danger, <i>who go abroad without their weapons, and
forget in the midst of daily dangers the means of preservation</i>.
Thomas, by his neglect, slid into a greater unbelief than the rest of
the apostles. David’s unwatchful heart was easily smitten by the
intelligence which his eyes brought him. They that would plead their
innocency against temptation had need to carry their arms and preservatives
still with them.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This truth is a sufficient caution against the <i>rash adventurousness
of those who forwardly engage themselves in matters of
temptation</i>. As the former observation told us, temptations are not
to be feared, so this also tells they are not to be slighted. The
carriage of the Philistines when the ark came among them is matter
of imitation to us. We may tremble justly when we hear of their
approach, but our hazard should be the whetstone of our courage, and
our danger should bring us to resolves of a more stout resistance, that
we may ‘quit ourselves like men.’</p>

<p>The apostle, Gal. vi. 1, seems to imply, when he tells those that
were more severe and careless of others, that ‘they may also be tempted,’
that the best of men do little know what a change a temptation may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
make upon them; a small temptation may be too strong for them, and
may carry them to what they never thought of; nay, may break down
the strongest of their resolves, and snap their purposes as a thread in
a flame. It did so with Peter, who was quickly overcome by that
which he had with so much confidence undervalued.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_III_3">CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The third circumstance, the place of the combat.—The advantage given
to temptations by solitude.</i></p>


<p>3. The third circumstance next to be considered is <i>the place of this
combat, ‘the wilderness.’</i> To inquire what or where this wilderness
was, is not only impertinent and useless, as to anything we can
observe from it in reference to temptation, but also a matter of mere
uncertain conjecture; only they that would understand it of a place
more thinly peopled are expressly contradicted by Mark i. 13, where
it is said, ‘he was with the wild beasts;’ noting thereby a desolate
and dangerous solitude, far remote from human society and comfort.</p>

<p>It is much more our concern to seek after the reasons of his choice
of that place, or rather among those many that are given, to satisfy
ourselves with what may have the greatest appearance of truth. They
that think Christ hereby designed to shew the uncertain changes and
vicissitudes of outward things in this life, or to point at the future low
estate of his church in the world, that it should sojourn in a wilderness;
or to direct those that have dedicated themselves to God to
withdraw from the blandishments and allurements of the earth, with
a great many more hints of instruction and document of that kind;
they, I say, that offer no other, seem not to attend to the true design
of the choice of this place, which notwithstanding is evidently discovered
to have been done in order to the temptation.<a id="FNanchor_363_363" href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> ‘He was led
into the wilderness <i>to be tempted</i>.’ The place then was subservient
to the conflict, as the proper theatre on which so great a contest was
to be acted. And if we shall but mind what special consideration
was to be had of such a place,—a howling desolate wilderness,—we
may with ease pitch upon these following reasons:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, It pleased God to have an eye to <i>the glory of Christ’s
conquests</i>, when in a single combat he should so remarkably foil the
devil, without any the least advantage on his part, there being none
that might be the least support or encouragement to him.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, The condition of the place <i>gave rise to the first
temptation</i>. For in that he ‘hungered’ in a barren wilderness, it gave
occasion to Satan to tempt him more strongly to ‘turn stones into
bread.’</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, In the choice of such a place God seems to offer
Satan a special <i>advantage in tempting</i>, which was the solitude and
danger of his present condition.</p>

<p>To omit the two former considerations, as not altogether so useful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
further than what I shall be engaged to speak to afterwards, this last
affords this observation:</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 4. <i>That solitude affords a great advantage to Satan in the
matter of temptation.</i> This advantage ariseth from solitude two ways:</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>As it doth deprive us of help</i>. So great and many are
the blessed helps arising from the society and communion of such as
fear the Lord, as counsel, comfort, encouragement from their graces,
experiences, and prayers, &amp;c., that the woe pronounced to him ‘that
is alone’ is not groundless, Eccles. iv. 10. Christians in a holy combination
can do more work, and so have a good reward for their
labour. They can mutually help one another when they fall; they
can mutually heat and warm one another; they can also strengthen
one another’s hands to prevail against an adversary. He then that is
alone, being deprived of these advantages, lieth more open to the
stroke of temptation.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>Solitude increaseth melancholy</i>, fills the soul with
dismal apprehensions; and withal doth so spoil and alter the temper
of it that it is not only ready to take any disadvantageous impression,
but it doth also dispose it to leaven and sour those very considerations
that should support, and to put a bad construction on things that
never were intended for its hurt.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This may warn us to take heed of giving Satan so great
an advantage against us, <i>as an unnecessary solitude may do</i>. I know
there are times and occasions that do justly require us to seek a solitary
place for the privacy of duty, or for secret lamentations, as Jeremiah
desired, chap. ix. 1, 2, or to avoid the trouble and snare arising
from our mixing with an assembly of treacherous and wicked men.
This is no more than care and watchfulness. But when these reasons
urge not, or some of like nature, but either out of pettish discontent
or a mopish reservedness, we withdraw from those aids and comforts
which are necessary for our support, we do strengthen Satan’s hands
against us and weaken our own.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV_3">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The fourth circumstance, the end wherefore Christ was led to the
wilderness.—Holiness, employment, privileges, exempt not from
temptation.—Of temptations that leave not impressions of sin behind
them.—How Satan’s temptations are distinguished from the lusts
of our own heart.</i></p>


<p>4. The fourth circumstance was <i>the end</i>. There was no other
design in the main of Christ’s being led up and into the wilderness,
but that he might be ‘tempted.’ In this two things seem to be matter
of equal wonder:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>Why Christ would submit to be tempted</i>. For this many
great and weighty reasons may be given. As,</p>

<p>[1.] First, Thus was Christ <i>evidenced to be the second Adam, and
the seed of the woman</i>. His being tempted, and in such a manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
doth clearly satisfy us that he was true man; and that in that nature
he it was that was promised ‘to break the serpent’s head.’</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, This was a fair <i>preludium and earnest of that final
conquest over Satan, and the breaking down of his power</i>.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, There was a more peculiar aim in God by these means
of temptation to qualify him with <i>pity and power to help</i>, ‘For in
that he suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are
tempted,’ Heb. ii. 18. And having experience of temptation himself,
he became a merciful high-priest, apt to be ‘touched with the feeling
of our infirmities,’ Heb. iv. 15.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>The consequence of this experimental compassion in
Christ</i>, was a further reason why he submitted to be tempted, to wit,
that we might have the greater comfort and encouragement in the
expectancy of tender dealing from him. Hence the apostle, Heb. iv.
16, invites to ‘come boldly to the throne of grace at any time of need.’</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, A further end God seemed to have in this, viz., <i>to
give a signal and remarkable instance to us of the nature of temptations</i>;
of Satan’s subtlety, his impudency, of the usual temptations
which we may expect; as also to teach us what weapons are necessary
for resistance, and in what manner we must manage them.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, It seems as strange that Satan would <i>undertake a
thing so unfeasible and hopeless as the tempting of Christ</i>. What
expectation could he have to prevail against him, who was ‘anointed
with the oil of gladness above his fellows’? [Ps. xlv. 7.] Some answer,</p>

<p>[1.] First, That Satan might possibly <i>doubt whether Christ were
the Son of God or no</i>. But the improbability of this I shall speak
of afterwards.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Others attribute it to his <i>malice</i>, which indeed is
great, and might possibly blind him to a desperate undertaking. But,</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, We may justly apprehend <i>the power of sin over Satan
to be so great that it might enforce him to the bold attempt of such a
wickedness</i>. We see daily that wicked men, by the force of their own
wicked principles, are restlessly hurried upon acts of sin, though they
know the prohibition, and are not ignorant of the threatened danger.
Satan is as great a slave to his own internal corrupt principles as any.
And whatsoever blind fury is stirred up in man by the power of his
lust, we may very well suppose the like in Satan.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>There is a superior hand upon the devil, that sways,
limits, and orders him in his temptations</i>. He cannot tempt when he
would, neither always what he would, but in his own cursed inclinations
and the acting of them, he is forced to be subservient to God’s
designs. And in this particular, whatever might be Satan’s proper
end or principle, it is evident that God carried on a gracious design
for the instruction and comfort of his children.</p>

<p>The end of Christ’s going to the wilderness being that he might be
tempted, if together with this the holiness and dignity of Christ in
respect of his person and office be considered, we may note from it,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 5. <i>That neither height of privilege, nor eminency of employment,
nor holiness of person, will discourage Satan from tempting, or
secure any from his assaults.</i> The best of men in the highest attainments
may expect temptations. Grace itself doth not exempt them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p>(1.) For first, None of these privileges <i>in us, nor eminencies of
grace, want matter to fix a temptation upon</i>. The weaknesses of the
best of men are such that a temptation is not rendered improbable, as
to the success, by their graces. Nay, there are special occasions and
inclinations in them, to encourage temptations of pride and neglect.
He found indeed nothing in Christ that might offer the least probability
of prevalency; but in the best of men, in their best estate, he
can find some encouragement for his attempts.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, None of us are beyond <i>the necessity of such exercises</i>.
It cannot be said that we need them not, or that there may not be
holy ends wherefore God should not permit and order them for our
good. Temptations, as they are in God’s disposal, are a necessary
spiritual physic. The design of them is to humble us, to prove us,
and to do us good in the latter end, Deut. viii. 16. Nothing will work
more of care, watchfulness, diligence, and fear in a gracious heart,
than a sense of Satan’s designment against it. Nothing puts a man
more to prayer, breathing after God, desiring to be dissolved, and
running to Christ, than the troublesome and afflictive pursuits of
Satan. Nothing brings men more from the love of the world, and to
a delight in the ordinances of God, than the trouble which here abides
them unavoidably from Satan. This discipline the best have need of.
There are such remainders of pride and other evils in them, that if
God should not permit these pricks and thorns to humble them, and
thereby also awaken them to laborious watchfulness, they would be
careless, secure, and sadly declining. This made Augustine conclude
that it was no way expedient that we should want temptations,<a id="FNanchor_364_364" href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> and
that Christ taught us as much when he directed us not to pray that
we should ‘not be tempted,’ but that we might not be ‘led into the
power and prevalency of temptation.’</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>The privileges and graces of the children of God do
stir up Satan’s pride, revenge, and rage against them</i>. And though
he hath no encouragement to expect so easy a conquest over these as
he hath over others, who are captivated by him at pleasure; yet hath
he encouragements to attempt them, for the singular use and advantage
he makes of any success against them, the difficulty of the work
being recompensed by the greatness of the booty. For the fall of a
child of God, especially of such as are noted above others, is as when
‘a standard-bearer fainteth,’ [Isa. x. 18;] or as the fall of an oak, that
bears down with it the lower shrubs that stand near it. How the hearts
of others fail for fear, lest they should also be overcome; how the hearts
of some grow thereby bold and venturesome; how a general disgrace
and discredit thereby doth accrue to religion, and the sincere profession
of it, are things of usual observation. If such men had not in them
something of special prey in case of conquest, his pride would not so
readily carry him against the heads and chief of the people, while he
seems to overlook the meaner and weaker. Out-houses, though more
accessible, are not the objects of the thief’s design, but the dwellinghouse,
though stronger built and better guarded, because it affords
hopes of richer spoil, is usually assaulted. Neither do pirates so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
set themselves to take empty vessels, though weakly manned, but richly
laden ships, though better able to make resistance, are the ships of
their desire.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> 1. This may be applied for <i>the encouraging of those that
think it strange that temptations do so haunt them</i>, especially that they
should, in their apprehension, be more troubled by him when they fly
furthest from him. The consideration of this will much allay these
thoughts, by these inferences which it affords:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>There is nothing unusual befalls these complainants</i>.
Satan frequently doth so to others; they cannot justly say their case is
singular, or that they are alone in such disturbances; it is but what is
common to man. If they urge the uncessantness of the devil’s
attempts, Christ and others have felt the like. If they object the
peculiar strangeness and horridness of the temptation, as most unsuitable
to the state of an upright soul, Christ met with the like. He was
tempted to self-destruction, to distrust, to blasphemy itself in the highest
degree.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>There is a good advantage to be made of them</i>: they
are preservations from other sins that would otherwise grow upon us.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, These temptations to the upright do but argue Satan’s
<i>loss of interest in them, and their greater sensibility of the danger</i>.
The captivated sinners complain not so much, because they are so
inured to temptation that they mind not Satan’s frequent accesses. He
that studies humility is more sensible of a temptation to pride than he
that is proud.<a id="FNanchor_365_365" href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></p>

<p>2. Secondly, This is also of use to those that are apt to be <i>confident
upon their successes against sin through grace</i>. Satan, they may see,
will be upon them again; so that they must behave themselves as
mariners, who, when they have got the harbour, and are out of the
storm, mend their ship and tackling, and prepare again for the sea.</p>

<p>Lastly, If we consider the unspotted holiness of Christ, and his constant
integrity under these temptations, that they left not the least of
taint or sinful impression upon him, we may observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 6. <i>That there may be temptations, without leaving a touch of
guilt or impurity behind them upon the tempted.</i></p>

<p>It is true this is rare with men. The best do seldom go down
to the battle, but in their very conquests they receive some wound;
and in those temptations that arise from our own hearts, we are never
without fault; but in such as do solely arise from Satan, there is a
possibility that the upright may so keep himself, that the wicked one
may not so touch him as to leave the print of his fingers behind him.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But the great difficulty is, How it may be known when temptations
are from Satan, and when from ourselves?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> To answer this I shall lay down these conclusions:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, The same sins which <i>our own natures would suggest to
us, may also be injected by Satan</i>. Sometimes we begin by the forward
working of our own thoughts upon occasions and objects presented
to us from without, or from the power of our own inclination,
without the offer of external objects, and then Satan strikes in with it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
Sometimes Satan begins with us, and by his injected motions endeavours
to excite our inclinations; so that the same thing may be sometime
from ourselves, and sometimes from Satan.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>There is no sin so vile, but our own heart might possibly
produce it without Satan</i>. Evil thoughts of the very worst kind,
as of murders, adulteries, thefts, false witness, and blasphemies may, as
Christ speaks, Mat. xv. 19, be produced naturally from our own hearts;
for seminally all sins, the very greatest of all impieties, are there. So
that from the greatness and vileness of the temptation we cannot absolutely
conclude that it is from Satan, no more than from the commonness
of the temptation, or its suitableness to our inclination, we can
conclude infallibly that its first rise is from ourselves.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, There are many cases wherein it <i>is very difficult, if
not altogether impossible, to determine whether our own heart or Satan
gives the first life or breathing to a temptation</i>. Who can determine,
in most ordinary cases, when our thoughts are working upon objects
presented to our senses, whether Satan or our own thoughts do run
faster? Yea, when such thoughts are not the consequent of any
former occasion, it is a work too hard for most men to determine
which of the parents, father or mother, our own heart or Satan, is first
in the fault. They are both forward enough, and usually join hand in
hand with such readiness, that he must have a curious eye that can
discover certainly to whom the first beginning is to be ascribed.</p>

<p>The difficulty is so great, that some have judged it altogether impossible
to give any certain marks by which it may be determined
when they are ours and when Satan’s.<a id="FNanchor_366_366" href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> And indeed the discoveries
laid down by some are not sufficient for a certain determination; and
so far I assent, that neither the suddenness of such thoughts—for the
motions of our own lusts may be sudden—nor the horridness of the
matter of them, are sufficient notes of distinction. That our own corrupt
hearts may bring forth that which is unnatural and terrible,
cannot be denied. Many of the sins of the heathens mentioned in
Rom. i. were the violent productions of lust against natural principles;
and to ascribe these to the devil, as to the first instigator, is more than
any man hath warrant to do. Yet though it be confessed that in some
cases it is impossible to distinguish, and that where a distinction may
be made, these notes mentioned are not fully satisfactory, there may, I
believe, be some cases wherein there is a possibility to discover when
the motions are from Satan, and that by the addition of some remarkable
circumstances to the fore-named marks of difference.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, Though it be true, which some say,<a id="FNanchor_367_367" href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> that in most
cases it is needless altogether to spend our time in disputing whether
the motions of sin in our minds are firstly from ourselves or from
Satan, our greatest business being rather to resist them than to difference
them; <i>yet there are special cases wherein it is very necessary to
find out the true parent of a sinful motion</i>, and these are when tender
consciences are wounded and oppressed with violent and great temptations,
as blasphemous thoughts, atheistical objections, &amp;c. For here
Satan in his furious molestations aims mainly at this, that such
afflicted and tossed souls should take all these thoughts which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
obtruded upon their imaginations, to be the issue of their own heart.
As Joseph’s steward hid the cup in Benjamin’s sack, that it might be
a ground of accusation against him, so doth the devil first oppress
them with such thoughts, and then accuseth them of all that villainy
and wickedness, the motions whereof he had with such importunity
forced upon them; and so apt are the afflicted to comply with accusations
against themselves, that they believe it is so, and from thence
conclude that they are given up of God, hardened as Pharaoh, that
they have sinned against the Holy Ghost, and finally that there is no
hope of mercy for them. All this befalls them from their ignorance
of Satan’s dealings, and here is their great need to distinguish Satan’s
malice from their guilt.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, Setting aside ordinary temptations, wherein it is
neither so possible nor so material to busy ourselves to find out whether
they are Satan’s or ours;—in extraordinary temptations, such as
have been now instanced, we may discover if they proceed from Satan,
though not simply from the matter of them, not from the suddenness
and independency of them, yet from <i>a due consideration of their nature
and manner of proceeding, compared with the present temper and
disposition of our heart</i>. As,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>When unusual temptations intrude upon us with a high
impetuosity and violence, while our thoughts are otherwise concerned
and taken up</i>.<a id="FNanchor_368_368" href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> Temptations more agreeable to our inclination,
though suddenly arising from objects and occasions presented, and
gradually proceeding, after the manner of the working of natural passions,
may throng in amidst our thoughts or actions that have no tendency
that way, and yet we cannot so clearly accuse Satan for them;
but when things that have not the encouragement of our affections are
by a sudden violence enforced upon us, while we are otherwise concerned,
we may justly suspect Satan’s hand to be in them.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, While such things are borne in upon us, against the
<i>actual loathing, strenuous reluctancy, and high complainings of the
soul, when the mind is filled with horror and the body with trembling
at the presence of such thoughts</i>.<a id="FNanchor_369_369" href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> Sins that owe their first original to
ourselves, may indeed be resisted upon their first rising up in our
mind; and though a sanctified heart doth truly loathe them, yet they
are not without some lower degree of tickling delight upon the affections;
for the flesh in those cases presently riseth up with its lustings
for the sinful motion; but when such unnatural temptations are from
Satan, their first appearance to the mind is a horror without any sensible
working of inclination towards them; and the greatness of the
soul’s disquiet doth shew that it hath met with that which the affections
look not on with any amicable compliance.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Our hearts may bring forth that which is <i>unnatural
in itself, and may give rise to a temptation that would be horrid to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
the thoughts of other men</i>, but that it should of its own accord, without
a tempter, on a sudden bring forth that which is directly contrary to
its present light, reason, or inclination; as for a man to be haunted
with thoughts of atheism, while he is under firm persuasions that there
is a God; or of blasphemy, while he is under designs of honouring him,
is as unimaginable as that our thoughts should of themselves contrive
our death, while we are most solicitous for our life; or that our
thoughts should soberly tell us it is night when we see the sun shine.
Temptations that are contrary to the present state, posture, light, and
disposition of the soul are Satan’s. They are so unnatural as to its
present frame, that the production of them must be from some other
agent.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Much more evident is it that such proceed from
Satan, when they are of <i>long continuance and constant trouble</i>, when
they so incessantly beat upon the mind, that it hath no rest from
them, and yet is under grievous perplexities and anxieties of mind
about them.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> The consideration of this is of great use to those that suffer
under the violent hurries of strange temptations.</p>

<p>(1.) First, In that sometime they can justly complain of <i>the affliction
of such temptation</i>, when they have no reason to charge it upon
themselves as their sin. It is one thing to be tempted, and another to
consent or comply. To be tempted, and not to be brought into temptation,
is not evil. Satan only barks when he suggests, but he then
bites and wounds when he draws us to consent.<a id="FNanchor_370_370" href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, That not only the <i>sin but the degree also</i>, by just
consequence, is to be measured by the consent of the heart. If we
consent not, the sin is not ours, and the less degree of consent we give,
the less is in the sin.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V_3">CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterwards
an hungered.</i>—Mat. iv. 2.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Christ’s fast, with the design thereof.—Of Satan’s tempting in an
invisible way.—Of his incessant importunities, and how he flies
when resisted.—Of inward temptations, with outward afflictions.—Several
advantages Satan hath by tempting in affliction.</i></p>


<p>I am next to explain <i>the fast of Christ, the end and design whereof,
because it is not expressly mentioned, is variously conjectured</i>. Not
to insist in this discourse, which is designed for practice, on the controversy
about the Quadragesimal fast, that which I shall first consider
is the opinion of Musculus,<a id="FNanchor_371_371" href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> who, upon this ground that his fast was
not the principal thing for which the Spirit led him into the wilderness;
for he was not led to fast, but to be tempted—thereupon concludes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
that this was only a consequent of his solitary condition in the wilderness,
and no other thing than what befell Moses and Elias, who being
engaged by God to attend him in such a service, where the ordinary
means of the support of life were wanting, were therefore kept alive
by him in an extraordinary way without them. Thus he thinks the
fasting was not, at least principally, designed, but that he being to
undergo a temptation in a desolate wilderness where he had no meat
to eat, there God restrained his hunger, so that he neither desired nor
needed any. If we acquiesce in this, it will afford this doctrine:—</p>

<p><i>Doct.</i> 1. <i>That when God leads forth his children to such services as
shall unavoidably deprive them of the ordinary means of help or supply,
there God is engaged to give extraordinary support, and his people
may expect it accordingly.</i></p>

<p>This is a great truth in itself, and a great and necessary encouragement
to all the children of God that are called out to straits; but I
shall not insist on this as the genuine product of this fast.</p>

<p>If we look further amongst protestant divines, we shall observe it
taken for granted, that Christ fasted upon design, and this is generally
reduced to those two heads:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, Either for <i>instruction</i>: as to shew that he was <i>God, by
fasting so long</i>, and that under the trouble of molesting and disquieting
temptations; whereas the fasts of like date in Moses or Elias were
accompanied with the quiet repose of their thoughts; or to shew that
he was <i>man, in that he really felt the natural infirmities of the human
nature, in being hungry</i>; or to teach us <i>the usefulness of fasting in the
general</i>, when fit occasions invite us thereto; or,</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>For confirmation of his doctrine</i>, to put an honour
and dignity upon his employment;<a id="FNanchor_372_372" href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> as Elias fasted at the restoring
of prophecy, and at the Reformation. As Moses fasted at the writing
of the law, so Christ began the gospel of the kingdom with fasting.
However, that these things cannot be spoken against, being conclusions
warrantably deducible from this act of Christ’s; yet these seem not,
in my apprehension, to come fully up to the proper end of this undertaking
of his; which seems not obscurely to be laid before us in that
passage of Luke iv. 2, ‘being forty days tempted of the devil; and in
those days he did eat nothing;’ where we see that his being ‘tempted
forty days’ was the principal thing, and that his fasting had a plain
reference and respect to his temptation. Thus far, I suppose, we
may be secure, that we have the design in the general, that his fasting
was in order to his temptation. But then whether this was designed
as an occasion of the temptations, or as a remedy against them, it is
not so easy to determine. That one of those, at least, was intended, cannot
be denied by those that will grant that his fast related to the
combat; and it seems not to labour of any repugnacy or absurdity, if
we say that it is possible that both these ends might be aimed at, and
accordingly I shall proceed to observe upon them. There are only
some other things to be first despatched out of the way: as</p>

<p>The continuance of the fast, why it was forty days, neither more
nor less. Though some adventure to give reasons for it,<a id="FNanchor_373_373" href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> not only
papists, who, according to their wont, are ridiculous and trifling in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
this matter; but also protestants, supposing that some regard was, or
ought to be, had to his fulfilling the times of the fasts of Moses and
Elias; yet I think it is neither pertinent nor safe to determine anything
about it, only it observes to us that the continuance of this was
a considerable time.</p>

<p>We are more concerned to inquire whether Christ was under any
conflict of temptation all that time;<a id="FNanchor_374_374" href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> which although some deny, lest
they should favour a seeming contradiction among the evangelists, yet
the words of Luke are so express, ‘being forty days tempted of the
devil,’ Luke iv. 2, that no tolerable evasion can be found to cast these
temptations to the end of the forty days; for he tells us, he was not
only tempted after the expiration of the forty days, but that he was
tempted during the continuance of the forty days beside; only there
was a difference in the kinds of these temptations, in regard of the
way wherein Satan managed them, and this also is fully set down by
Matthew, ‘And when the tempter came to him,’ which with the other
expression of Luke compared, shews us, that during the space of the
forty days Satan tempted Christ, and yet came not to him till afterward—that
is, he managed those temptations in an invisible way.
Hence we may note,</p>

<p><i>Doct.</i> 2. <i>That Satan doth usually tempt in an invisible way and
manner.</i> To explain this a little, I shall evidence it by a few considerations.
As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>That he hath a hand in all sins first or last, and then
it must needs be in an invisible way</i>. His work is to tempt, to go
about laying snares to draw men to sin. Wicked men are ‘of their
father the devil,’ John viii. 44, and do his works. Carnal desires are
‘his lusts;’ giving way to anger is ‘giving place to the devil,’ Eph. iv.
26, 27, and resisting of sin is called in the general, ‘a resisting of the
devil,’ &amp;c., James iv. 7. In all this work of Satan, men do not see him.
When he puts evil motions into their hearts they do not perceive him,
and therefore doth he his work in an invisible way.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, We have sufficient discoveries of these private paths
of his: for, [1.] Sometime he tempts by <i>friends</i>: he tempted Job by
his wife, Christ by Peter. [2.] Sometime by <i>external objects</i>, as he
drew out Achan’s covetousness, and David’s uncleanness, by the eye.
[3.] Sometime by <i>injecting thoughts and motions</i> to our mind. [4.]
Sometime by exercising an <i>invisible power upon our bodies</i>, in stirring
up the humours thereof, to provoke to passion or excessive mirth. All
these ways, of which I have discoursed before more largely, are secret
and invisible, and by such as these he most usually tempts.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>The wiles, depths, secrets, and devices of Satan</i>, which
the Scripture tells us are his most familiar ways and courses, they in
their own nature imply a studied or designed secrecy and imperceptibility.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, He hath peculiar <i>reasons of policy</i> for his invisible
way of dealing; for the less visible he is, the less suspicious are his
designs, and consequently the less frightful and more taking. By this
way he insinuates himself so into our bosoms, that he gets a party in
us against ourselves before we are aware; whereas in vain he knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
he should spread his net if his designs and enmity were discovered to
us.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This must teach us to suspect Satan where we see him
not, and so to converse with objects and occasions as still fearing that
there may be <i>anguis in herba</i>, a secret snare laid for us to entrap us
at unawares.</p>

<p>If we again cast our eyes upon what hath been said, that Christ was
tempted ‘all the forty days,’ it will then give us this observation:—</p>

<p><i>Doct.</i> 3. <i>That Satan is sometime incessant in temptations, and sets
upon us with continued importunities.</i></p>

<p>Here we may note a distinction of temptations, besides that of invisible
and visible, of which I have spoken, that some are moveable
and short fits, and as it were skirmishes, in which he stays not long,
and others are more fixed and durable. We may call them solemn
temptations, in which Satan doth, as it were, pitch down his tents,
and doth manage a long siege against us. Of these last sort is this
observation.</p>

<p>Thus he tempted Paul, continuing his assault for some time before
he departed, 2 Cor. xii. 8. Thus also he dealt with Joseph, who was
solicited day by day for a long time together, Gen. xxxix. 10. Of
these I shall note a few things. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, Such temptations are not without a <i>special commission</i>.
He cannot indeed tempt at all without leave, but in the ordinary
course of his temptations he hath a general commission under such
restraints and limitations as pleaseth the Most High to put upon him;
but in these he must have a special order, as we see in Job’s case.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Such temptations have also <i>a special ground</i>. Either
the present state and posture of our condition is such as Satan apprehends
highly advantageous for his design, and therefore he desires to
have the winnowing of us at such a season; or there are more than
ordinary dispositions and inclinations in our heart to what we are
directly tempted to, or to some other consequent design. These
animate and encourage him to high resolves of prosecuting us more
closely, upon an expectation that a continued solicitation is most likely
to prevail at the long run.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, It is possible that such temptations <i>may stand out
against the endeavours of many prayers</i>, and that we shall find they
are not so easily shaken off as the viper that was upon Paul’s hand.
Paul, 2 Cor. xii. 8, prayed thrice against the messenger of Satan, that
is, as Estius and others interpret, he prayed often and fervently, and
yet it departed not.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, Such temptations give <i>no rest nor intermission</i>;
men are haunted and dogged by them; what way soever they go,
they still hear the same things, and cannot command their thoughts
to give an exclusion to his motions, but still by renewed disputes and
arguings, or by clamorous importunities, they are vexed and tormented:
which surely shews a high degree of earnestness and impudency
in Satan.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, These are consequently <i>very burdensome, exceeding
irksome and tiresome to us</i>. Paul calls them ‘buffetings,’ for their
trouble and molestation. Satan so molested Job in his affliction by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
inward accusations and troubles of terror, that, as an overwearied man,
he cries out he had no quiet, and that he was disappointed of his hope
of ease in sleep, because he was then ‘scared with dreams and terrified
with visions,’ [Job vii. 14.]</p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, These are also upon a special design <i>on God’s part,
either to find us work and to keep us doing, or to prevent sin and
miscarriage</i>; to keep down our pride, lest we should be ‘exalted
above measure,’ [2 Cor. xii. 7;] to awaken us from slothfulness and
security, lest we should ‘settle upon our lees,’ [Jer. xlviii. 11;] or to
be an occasion of his grace, and an evidence of his power in our preservation,
satisfying us and others, that in the greatest shocks of our
spiritual battle his ‘grace is sufficient for us,’ [2 Cor. xii. 9.] Upon
these, and such like designs as these, doth the most wise God permit
it.</p>

<p>(7.) Seventhly, Satan doth not attempt temptations of this kind but
upon <i>a special design</i>, and that either because he hopes by a violent
and pertinacious impetuosity at length to prevail, or that he would
please himself to molest us; for surely the cries and complainings of
God’s children are music in his ears; or at least upon a design to discourage
us in our services, and to make way for other temptations of
murmuring, blasphemy, despair, &amp;c., which are as a reserve or ambushment
laid in wait for us. The inferences from hence are these
two:—</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> 1. That the children of God under such temptations may
be encouraged under a patient expectation, by considering that Christ
did undergo the like assaults from Satan. It is in itself tedious and
disheartening, but they may see,</p>

<p>(1.) First, That this way of trouble <i>is usual, and that to the best</i>;
and therefore they should not faint under it.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, That grace <i>is sufficient to preserve from the prevalency
of the most earnest temptations</i> even there, where our heavenly
Father thinks it not fit to preserve us from the trouble of them. When
Paul gives the highest security that the faithfulness of God can afford,
that temptations shall not be above strength, 1 Cor. x. 13, or the
ability that shall be given them, he tells them they are not to expect
always such aids as shall presently drive away the temptation, that it
must immediately vanish, or that their temptations shall become light
and contemptible, but that God’s faithfulness will be no further engaged
in the general, than [1.] to make their temptations tolerable,
that they ‘may be able to bear them,’ though not without much to
do. [2.] That the ‘way of escape’ shall be concurrent with the continuance
of the temptation, that though the temptation abide, yet we
shall be aided under it. [3.] That yet he is as careful of our help in
temptations as he is ready to commissionate them, when need requires.
His resolves that we should be tempted, and his resolves that we
should be succoured, they bear the same date. ‘With the temptation
he will make a way to escape.’</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, That such temptations do not argue [1.] either a
likelihood, much less a necessity, that they should prevail; nor [2.] any
want of care and love in God; nor [3.] do they always evidence a
more than ordinary proneness and inclination in us; for Christ, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
was most averse to the least of sin, who was highest in God’s love,
against whom there was no possibility he should prevail, yet was thus
tempted.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> 2. Secondly, In such continued violences it will concern us
to <i>make stout resistances</i>; according to the counsel of James, chap.
iv. 7, ‘Resist the devil, and he will fly.’</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But I have done so, and yet the temptation is the same, and
still continues.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> (1.) First, It is not enough <i>to resist, but we must continue to
do so</i>. Some make limited resistances, as besieged persons that set a
time for their holding out, and then if they be not relieved at that
time, they yield; but we must resolve a perpetual resistance, as long
as the temptation lasts. When one hand is beaten off, we must hold
by another; when both are beaten off, we must, as it were, hold by
our teeth.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, In a faithful resistance, we may <i>cast the whole matter
upon God</i>, and engage him in the quarrel; as David: ‘I will say unto
God, Why hast thou forsaken me?’ &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But how is it consistent with truth that the temptation should
continue, when James tells us that Satan will fly upon resistance?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> (1.) It may be <i>the resistance is not as it ought, and so the
blame is ours</i>. If we be not serious, as some who defy the devil in
words, and resist him by crossing themselves, things which doubtless
the devil laughs at; or if in the confidence of a presumptuous bravado,
or if not with that humility and care that is requisite, it will be no
wonder if he depart not.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>He doth fly at every resistance more or less</i>; he
doth give back, and is discouraged, and is a loser by every opposition.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Though the scripture say that he shall fly,—that is,
sooner or later,—yet it doth not say <i>that he shall do so immediately</i>,
though most usually he doth so where he is peremptorily rejected.
But in some cases time must be allowed; for the devil, as it is in
Chrysostom’s comparison, stands like a fawning dog scratching and
waving his tail, and if anything be given him, it makes him importunate
for more; yet though we give him nothing, we cannot expect
that the first or second denial should make him cease his trouble: as
he hath been encouraged by former compliances, so will he not be discouraged
but with many and continued denials.</p>

<p>If we consider the fast of Christ as an occasion designed by God
for an advantage to the temptation, and then look upon his condition
in the wilderness, being under hazards from wild beasts, in want of
necessaries, and without a possibility of supplies in a usual way, and
also under the discomforts of cold and long nights,—for according to
the conjectures of some this was about our October and November<a id="FNanchor_375_375" href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a>—then
we may observe,</p>

<p><i>Doct.</i> 4. <i>That it is Satan’s way to second outward distresses and
afflictions with inward temptations.</i> We see the like carriage of
Satan toward Job. His affliction was followed with many temptations.
All his friends, in urging him with hypocrisy, were no other than
parties to Satan’s design, though they knew it not apparently. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
wife is set on by the tempter, as the serpent against Eve, to provoke
him to ‘curse God and die.’ Besides all this, whosoever shall consider
what inward workings of heart, spiritual trouble and conflict, his
words frequently express, they will quickly find that when God put
Job into Satan’s hand, under that only limitation of not touching his
life, he gave Satan a liberty to pursue him with inward temptations as
well as outward vexations. When Israel was pinched with the straits
of the wilderness, Satan was most busy with them to put them upon
distrust, murmuring, revolt, disobedient oppositions, idolatry, and
what not. David gives in his experience to confirm this truth. He
never met with outward troubles but he had also inward temptations
with them, as fretting, disquiet, sad apprehensions of God’s wrath,
haste, distrust, fear, &amp;c., as the relation of his several straits do testify.
And besides these, the generality of God’s children find it so. Outward
afflictions seldom pass alone. When they have ‘fightings without,’
they have ‘fears within’ usually. Seldom have they a sickness,
or meet with a sad providence, but they have Satan busy with their
souls, molesting their peace, or endeavouring to ensnare them. Thus
their feet are never in the stocks but the iron enters into their soul.
And for this reason is it that outward afflictions and troubles are called
temptations in Scripture, because temptations usually accompany them,
and they are indeed the solemn seasons that Satan desires to improve
for that end; and for that is it that Luke expresseth that which we
translate a time of temptation by καιρὸς πειρασμοῦ, which signifies an
occasion or opportunity of temptation, Luke viii. 13; 1 Peter i. 6;
2 Peter ii. 9.</p>

<p>The temptations that Satan drives on, upon the advantage of an
afflicted estate, are these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, To drive men upon <i>impatient outbreakings against God</i>,
as the Israelites in the wilderness turn upon Moses with this, ‘Hast
thou brought us into the wilderness to slay us?’ [Exod. xiv. 11.] To
this tended Job’s temptation by his wife, ‘Curse God, and die,’ as it is
in our translation, which cannot in anywise admit of the excuse that
Beza makes for her, as if she gave wholesome advice, ‘to die blessing
of God,’ because he reproves her sharply as having spoken foolishly
and wickedly; but at best it is an ironical scoff at Job’s integrity,
‘Dost thou bless God while thou art killed by his displeasure?’ if it
be not a direct suggestion of revengeful despite. At such times men
are too apt to entertain cruel thoughts of God, and sadly reflective
upon his mercy or justice.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, In this posture of affliction he strives to put them
<i>upon direful conclusions against themselves</i>, as if God called solemnly
their sin to remembrance, and that they are forsaken of God, and
marked out for destruction, the pledge and earnest whereof they take
these troubles to be. We may observe that David’s afflictions awakened
his conscience to object guilt and miscarriage, so that he is as
earnest to deprecate the marking and remembrance of his sin as he is
to pray against his troubles. For this see Ps. xxv. 6, 7, xxxviii.
1, 4.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, He pusheth them usually upon <i>contempt of religion,
and abandoning the ways of God</i>. We are too apt to blame religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
for all our troubles; and as we expect that our owning the ways of
God should secure us from outward affliction, so when we find it otherwise
we are too forward to say, ‘We have washed our hands in vain,’
&amp;c., [Ps. lxxiii. 13.]</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>The sin of distrust is another evil that he drives at</i>;
he would have men conclude that God cannot or will not deliver.
‘Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?’ said the Israelites, by
the power of temptation, when they were distressed, [Ps. lxxviii. 19.]</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, Another evil aimed at in such a case, is to put us
upon <i>indirect courses and ways to escape from our troubles</i>. <i>Flectere
si nequeo superos</i>, &amp;c. Saul went to the witch of Endor when God
answered him not. Distresses naturally prompt such things, and
a little temptation makes us comply, as is noted by the wise man’s
desire, ‘Give me not poverty, lest I put out my hand and steal,’ [Prov.
xxx. 9.] Distresses of poverty put men upon theft and unlawful ways.</p>

<p>The reasons of Satan’s tempting the afflicted are these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, That outward afflictions are <i>a load and burden</i>. This
gives a probability that his designs may the better take place. It is
easy to overthrow those that are bowed down, to break those that are
bruised, to master those that are weary and weak-handed.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, An afflicted estate is <i>a temptation of itself, and
naturally dictates evil things</i>. It is half of his design brought to his
hand, it affords variety of matter for a temptation to work on.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Such a condition <i>strongly backs a temptation, and
furnisheth many arguments for a prevalency</i>; for troubles are serious
things; they speak to the heart, and what they speak, they speak
fiercely; they represent things otherwise than common discovery can
do, and for the most part they shew an ingenuity in multiplying fears,
and aggravating hazard, and ascertaining suspected events, so that
Satan can scarce desire a fairer hit than what these offer him.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, They also give him the advantage <i>of darkness</i>; for
to such their ‘way is hid,’ Job iii. 23, and God hath hedged them in;
they neither know where they are, whether their trouble be a chastisement
of sin, or for trial, or for prevention of miscarriage, or to make
way for more comfortable manifestations; and as little know they how
to behave themselves in their trouble, or how and when to get out of
it. In such groping uncertainties, it is scarce possible but they should
be put wrong.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, An afflicted condition brings <i>on weakness and indisposition
to duty</i>; it makes the hands weak, and the knees feeble.
This made Job to faint, chap. iv. 5; this dried up David’s strength.
The first assault of an affliction doth stound, and put it into
such a confusion, that hope turns back, and faith is to seek, and every
grace so out of order, that a man shall be unable to do anything
of duty in a comfortable manner.</p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, In this case men are apt to conclude <i>their prayers are
not heard</i>: ‘I cry in the day-time, and thou hearest not,’ [Ps. xxii.
2,] says David; ‘Hath the Lord forgotten to be gracious?’ [Ps. lxxvii.
9.] And with such seeming probability is this urged upon us by
affliction, that Job professeth he could not believe his own sense and
knowledge in such a case. ‘If I had called, and he had answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice,’
Job ix. 16.</p>

<p>(7.) Seventhly, Afflictions strongly <i>fix guilt upon us</i>, and represent
God ‘searching out our iniquities, and inquiring after our sin,’
Job x. 6.</p>

<p>(8.) Eighthly, They <i>imbitter the spirit</i>, and beget impressions upon
the mind, of very hard thoughts of God.</p>

<p>(9.) Ninthly, They violently push men on <i>to speak unadvisedly</i>.
There is such a swelling ferment of the old leaven of impatience and
distrust in the mind, that it is matter of pain and difficulty to be
silent: ‘Their belly is as wine that hath no vent; it is ready to burst
like new bottles,’ and they are ‘weary with forbearing and cannot
stay, and must speak let come on them what will,’ Job xxxii. 19.</p>

<p>All these advantages doth an afflicted condition bring to Satan; and
who can think that he who is so studious of our ruin will be willing
to miss so fair an opportunity?</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> (1.) First, This must teach us to have <i>a watchful eye over
affliction</i>. Though at all times we must expect Satan’s stratagems,
yet in troubles especially prepare for them; according to the wise
man’s advice, ‘In a day of adversity, consider,’ [Eccles. vii. 14.]</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Seeing Satan takes advantage of the sharp humours
of impatience and distrust, we must be particularly careful not <i>to
touch too much upon the harshness of our troubles</i>, because this is that
that sets fretting and distracting thoughts on work. Afflictions, like
the pillar of the cloud and fire in the wilderness, have a light and
darkness; and accordingly, those that converse with the dark side
of troubles envenom their imaginations, and poison their thoughts
with dark and hideous conclusions, and, in a word, draw forth nothing
but the wormwood and the gall; whereas those that study and view
the light side of them are full of praise and admiration for the
gracious mixtures, comfortable mitigations, encouraging supports, &amp;c.,
which they observe. It is wisdom then to keep upon the right side
of them.</p>

<p>Though it be the design of God to turn the dark side of the cloud
to us, yet may we have a competent light to guide us if we would improve
it. When the sun is set, the moon may be up. Nay, it is our
duty to strive to recover the right side of the cloud. He hides that
we may seek.</p>

<p>If this fast of Christ’s be considered as a remedy against temptations,
then may we observe <i>that solemn temptations are to be resisted
with fastings and prayers</i>. Of this I shall forbear to speak, till I
come to speak of Christ’s answer, and the repulse of Satan.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>




<h3 id="CHAPTER_VI_3">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of
God, command that these stones be made bread.</i>—Mat. iv. 3.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>That Christ’s temptations were real and not in vision.—That temptation
is Satan’s employment, with the evidences and instances thereof.—Of
Satan’s tempting visibly, with the reasons thereof.</i></p>


<p>Next follows a particular account of those more eminent temptations
wherewith Christ was assaulted by Satan. Before I speak of
these, I must necessarily remove this stumbling-block out of the way,
viz., whether Christ was really tempted, or only in a vision. That
this was but visionary hath been supposed; not only by some, whose
conceits in other things might justly render their supposals in this
matter less worthy of a serious consideration,<a id="FNanchor_376_376" href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> but also by very grave
and serious men,<a id="FNanchor_377_377" href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> whose reasons, notwithstanding, are not of that
weight as to sway us against the letter and history of these temptations,
which give us a full account of these things as really transacted,
without the least hint of understanding them as done only in a
vision. For,</p>

<p>(1.) First, It is a dangerous thing to depart from <i>the literal sense
of what is historically related</i>. If we take such a liberty, we may as
well understand other historical passages after the same rate, and
so bring the history, not only of Christ’s suffering to a visionary and
fantastical cross, but also of all the New Testament to a very
nothing.<a id="FNanchor_378_378" href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>The circumstances of the temptation are so particularly
set down</i>—as the devil’s coming to him, leaving him, taking
him to the temple, &amp;c.—that if we may expect in anything to secure
ourselves from a visionary supposition, we may do it in this history.<a id="FNanchor_379_379" href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, This imagination doth wholly <i>enervate and make
void the very end and design of Christ’s being tempted</i>; for where
were the glory of this victory over Satan, if it were only a visionary
temptation, and a visionary conquest? or where were the comfort and
encouragement which believers—from the apostle’s authority, Heb.
ii. 18, and iv. 16—might reap from this, that Christ imagined himself
to be tempted, when really he was not so? Nay, how impossible
is it to make that expression of the apostle, ‘He was tempted in all
points like as we are,’ to agree to an imaginary temptation? except
we also say that we are only tempted visionarily and not really?</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, Neither is it a plea of any value against this truth,
that it seems to <i>derogate too much from the honour and authority of
our Saviour, that Satan should so impudently assault him with temptations
to worship him, and should carry him at pleasure from place to
place</i>, when we find that he voluntarily submitted to higher indignities
from Satan’s instruments, and ‘turned not away his cheek’ from those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
that ‘smote’ him, spit upon him, and contumeliously mocked him, and
at last submitted to death, even the death of the cross.<a id="FNanchor_380_380" href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p>As for those objections from πτερύγιον ἱεροῦ, the pinnacle of the
temple, upon which Scultetus thinks it was impossible for Christ to
stand; as also the objection of the impossibility to shew the kingdoms
of the world from any mountain, I shall answer them in their proper
place. In the meantime I shall return to the verse in hand, in which
I shall first pitch upon the general <i>proæmium</i>, or introduction to these
special temptations, which is this, ‘The tempter came to him.’</p>

<p>In this we are to take notice of the name given to Satan, and also
the way and manner of the assault, in that expression, ‘he came to
him.’</p>

<p>There are three distinct names given to him in these temptations.
[1.] His name ‘Satan’ shews his malice and fury, which is the
ground and fountain whence all that trouble proceeds which we meet
with from him. [2.] He is styled ‘the tempter,’ and that signifies to us
how he puts forth this malice, his way and exercise in the exerting of
it. [3.] He is called ‘the devil’ or accuser, expressing thereby the
end and issue of all. From this name, then, here given, we may
observe:—</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 1. First, <i>That it is Satan’s work and employment to tempt men</i>.
We need not here dispute whether it be proper to Satan to tempt—that
is, <i>an soli, et semper competat</i>, whether it agree to him only and
always, which some indeed affirm in such a sense as this, that men do
tempt men as Satan’s instruments, the world tempts as it is the object
and matter of temptations, but Satan tempts as the proper author and
engineer of temptations. Others there are that think that men can
and do properly tempt themselves, according to James i. ‘Every
man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust.’<a id="FNanchor_381_381" href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> But the
question is altogether needless as to us; though we and others may be
true and proper tempters, yet this hindereth not but that it is most
true, that Satan makes temptation his very work and business. And
therefore not only here, but in 1 Thes. iii. 5, the devil is described by
his employment, ‘Lest by any means the tempter,’ or he that
tempteth, ‘hath tempted you:’ which the ordinary gloss doth thus
explain, <i>Diabolus, cujus est officium tentare</i>. This name, then, is put
upon Satan, κατ’ ἐξοχὴν, by way of eminency. Implying, [1.] That
though there be never so many tempters, yet Satan is the chief. [2.]
That he makes temptation his proper employment.</p>

<p>That Satan doth so, I shall evidence by these few notes:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, Temptation is in itself <i>a business and work</i>. For if we
consider either the work of any one temptation, where Satan is oft
put to it, after suggestion to persuade, and after persuasion to instigate
and provoke; or if we consider what furniture, tools, means, and
instruments are requisite, and what it may cost to bring all things together
into fit order and method; or if we think of the various ways
and manners of temptation, that some are mediate, some immediate;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
some inward, some outward; some moveable, some fixed and solemn;
some enticements to evil, some affrightments from duty, others invasions
of our peace and joy; or lastly, if we call to mind what
study, what art, what fetches and contrivances the devil is sometimes
put upon, we shall easily see that it keeps him doing, and
that he eats not the bread of idleness that hath that employment to
follow.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Satan <i>gives up himself unto it, is wholly in it</i>. He
‘walks to and fro,’ ‘goes about’ seeking advantages of this nature,
‘compasseth sea and land’ to proselyte men to his slavery, useth all
means, upon all men, at all times, with all diligence. Hence was it
that Latimer, in his homely way of speaking, called him ‘a busy
bishop in his diocese,’ and excited the sluggish to learn laboriousness
of the devil.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>He takes a delight in it, not only from a natural propensity,
which his fall put upon him, whereby he cannot but tempt</i>—as
an evil tree cannot but bring forth evil fruits—but also from the
power of a habit acquired by long exercise, which is accompanied
with some kind of pleasure; and further, whatever pleasure may be
supposed to arise from revengeful pride or companionship in evil, he
hath of that in full measure, pressed down, and running over. <i>Solamen
miseris</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, All other things in Satan, or in his endeavours,
have either a <i>subserviency, or some way or other a reference and respect
to temptation</i>. His power, wisdom, malice, and other infernal
qualifications, render him able to tempt; his labour and diligence in
other things are but the work of one that prepares materials and
occasions; his other business of accusing, affrighting, destroying, tormenting,
are but the ends and improvements of tempting.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, <i>He cares not how it goes on, so that it go on</i>; as a
man that designs to be rich, cares not how he gets it; which shews
that tempting in general is his design. Of this we have many instances,
as [1.] He sticks not to lie and dissemble; he will tell them of
the ‘kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,’ and a thousand
fair promises which he never intends. [2.] He will tempt for a small
matter; if he can but gain a little, or but molest us, yet he will be
doing. [3.] He will not give over for a foil or disappointment. [4.]
He is not ashamed to tempt contradictory things: he tempted Christ
against the work of redemption, ‘Master, spare thyself,’ [Mat. xvi. 22.]
He tempted Judas to further it in betraying him. [5.] Any temptation
that he sees will hold, he takes up. Hence is it that he tempts
not the Jews now to idolatry, because he hath them fast in another
snare, being strongly led to an opposition and contempt of Christ.
[6.] He will sometime tempt where he hath not probability to prevail,
even against hope. Thus he tempted Christ and Paul.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> (1.) The use of the observation is this, <i>If it be his business
to tempt, it must be our work to resist</i>.</p>

<p>[1.] First, To resist <i>is a labour</i>. It is not an idle formality, consisting
in words of defiance, or a few ridiculous crossings and sprinklings
of holy water, or spitting at the name of him, as ignorant people
are wont to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>We must give up ourselves to this work</i>, always fighting
and opposing.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, It will be necessary to <i>make use of all helps</i>, as prayer,
fasting, the counsel and support of holy and experienced men.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>We must also cast off all hindrances</i>. Whatsoever
in us is apt to take fire or give advantage must be laid off, as pride,
which doth prognosticate a fall, and security, which betrays the best,
or presumption, which provokes God to leave those of highest attainments,
Neh. xiii. 16.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, In this general introduction, we may cast our eye upon
<i>the way and manner of the assault</i>. When it is said, ‘the tempter came
unto him,’ we are unavoidably forced to suppose another manner of
coming than that whereby he tempted him for forty days together.
And when we call to mind that at his coming here mentioned, he
carried Christ to the temple, and from thence to a high mountain,
and there propounded himself an object of worship; we can imagine
no less than that Satan here came visibly to him. But in what shape
or manner of appearance it is altogether uncertain, though it is most
probable it was not in the form of a brute, but in some lustre of
majesty or glory, as an angel, because a deformed or base appearance
had been unsuitable to the boast of giving ‘the kingdoms of the world,’
or to his desire that Christ should ‘fall down and worship him.’
Hence we may observe:—</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 2. <i>That Satan sometimes tempts in a visible appearance, and
by voice.</i></p>

<p>[1.] First, The possibility of this is evident from <i>the apparitions of
angels</i>. Satan is still an angel, and there is nothing of a natural incapacity
in him as to an outward appearance to our eyes and senses,
more than in glorified spirits.<a id="FNanchor_382_382" href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>In the first temptation he did no less, when he used the
serpent as a trunk to speak through, and an instrument to act by</i>. In
possessions he speaks audibly, and evidenceth a real presence.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>Undoubted instances may be given of Satan’s tempting
and molesting visibly</i>. I deny not but there are a great many
idle stories of this kind, and a number of ridiculous figments; but it
would be unreasonable and highly prejudicial to the truth of history,
and the common faith of mankind, to refuse credit to the serious
accounts of sober men, because of some foolish and unwarrantable
fables.</p>

<p>What is related of Luther and his several troubles from Satan this
way, is evident in the story of his life. Cyrillus tells us of one
Eusebius, disciple of Jerome, who when he was dying, cried out of the
devil’s appearing to him. The like is storied of St Martin and others,
and of these, you may read more collected by Mr Clark.<a id="FNanchor_383_383" href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>If we would inquire into the reasons of Satan’s appearing thus, we
cannot more fitly pitch upon any other than these:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p>[1.] First, Either he thinks a great affrightment necessary in some
cases, and for that end appears. Or,</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He sees his appearance needful, to give a greater
evidence and certainty to the reality of the pleasures of sin which he
promiseth. That is the common ground of his appearing in the ways
and designs of witchcraft.</p>

<p>[3.] Or thirdly, In the height of rage, when he perceives other ways
not available, and when he hath to do with persons not ignorant of his
devices, where he sees he hath no need of a visor, or covert ways of
dealing, then he sticks not, if permitted, to tempt or molest openly.</p>

<p>This must teach us not to wonder at such temptations, much less
to judge those that may be so molested, as if Satan had a greater share
in them, seeing Christ was thus tempted.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_VII_3">CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The general view of these temptations.—Of Satan’s gradual proceeding
in temptations.—Of reserving a great temptation last.—What a
great temptation is; in what cases to be expected.—Of Satan’s using
a common road, in comparing these temptations with the ordinary
temptations of men.—Of the advantage Satan takes of natural
appetite, sense, and affections.</i></p>


<p>I have done with the <i>proæmium</i> to the temptations. Yet before I
open them particularly, I shall take a general view of them. First,
By comparing these with the other temptations of Christ during the
forty days. Secondly, By comparing these with the temptations of
men.</p>

<p>1. First then, If we compare these with the former temptations,
and observe that we have no account given us of those temptations,
but only in the general, ‘that he was tempted,’ whereas these are particularly
set down and recorded, we cannot apprehend less than this,
<i>that these last temptations were certainly greater and more remarkable
temptations</i>. Hence note,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 3. <i>That it is Satan’s method to be gradual in his temptations,
and that he keeps his greatest temptations to the latter end.</i></p>

<p>That Satan is gradual in his temptations; this is true of him, if we
regard,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>The manner of his proceeding</i>, that he drives slowly,
entreats gently, and is very careful that he do not over-drive men, but
after they are accustomed to his way, he puts on imperiousness and
commands them.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>If the matter of temptation be regarded</i>, he is
gradual there also. He tempts to little sins first, then to greater.</p>

<p>I shall illustrate both these particulars by the example of Thomas
Savage, apprentice to Mr Collins, vintner at the Ship Tavern, in
Ratcliffe, who suffered in <i>anno</i> 1660, for murdering his fellow-servant.
He confesseth that the devil took this course with him: he first
tempted him to neglect of duty, then to contempt of ordinances and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
profanation of the Sabbath, then to drinking, then to fornication, then
to rob and steal from his master, and last of all to murder; and takes
particular notice that in this last temptation, to kill his fellow-servant,
there was a violent and more than ordinary power of Satan upon him,
to instigate him to that wickedness. All this you may read at large
in the printed narration of his life.</p>

<p>(1.) The reasons of his gradual proceedings are,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>He would discover no more of himself in any temptation
than he is necessitated unto for the gaining his end</i>, lest he cross his
own design, and instead of drawing men to wickedness, scare or
affright them from it.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Sins are mutually preparatory to each other</i>. Smaller
proffers and temptations do insensibly prepare and incline the heart to
greater.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, That he keeps his greatest temptations last, is a
consequence of the former; for which, besides what is now spoken,
these reasons may be given:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>There is provocation given him in refusing his lesser
assaults</i>. His ‘head is bruised’ by every refusal, he is set at defiance,
which calls him out to stronger opposition. He perceives by often
repulses that those with whom he hath to do are not subjects of his
kingdom, and that his ‘time is short,’ and therefore no wonder is it, if
he assault most furiously and with all his strength.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>There is also policy in it</i>. When he hath brought
down our strength and weakened our courage, then a violent onset is
fair to procure him a victory.</p>

<p>But because I mention a great temptation, it may not be amiss
both for the further explaining of the text, and illustration of the
matter, to shew what is a great temptation. These were great temptations
to Christ, and there are several things remarkable in them,
which, wherever they appear, they will denominate the temptation
great, and the more of them are conjoined together, and in higher
degree, it may justly be called still the greater. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, In these temptations, we may note there were <i>external
objects as well as insinuated suggestions</i>. Inward motions are real
temptations, but when they have the objects and things presented to
the eye or the senses, then do they strongly urge. At this advantage
the devil tempted Eve. He urged her when the fruit was within the
view. Thus he tempted Achan, when the gold and garment were in
his eye.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>These temptations were complex</i>, consisting of many
various designs, like a snare of many cords or nooses. When he
tempted to turn stones to bread, it was not one single design, but
many, that Satan had in prosecution. As distrust on one hand, pride
on another, and so in the rest. The more complicated a temptation
is, it is the greater.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>These were also perplexing, entangling temptations</i>.
They were dilemmatical,<a id="FNanchor_384_384" href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> such as might ensnare, either in the doing
or refusal. If he had turned stones into bread, he had too much
honoured Satan by doing it at his motion. If he did not, he seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
to neglect his own body, in not making necessary provisions for himself,
being now hungry.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>These temptations proceeded upon considerable advantages</i>.
His hunger urged a necessity of turning stones into bread.
His present straits, and the lowness of his condition, seemed to speak
much for the reasonableness of giving proof of his divine nature, by
casting himself down from the temple, and of doing anything that
might tend to a more plentiful being and support in the world. Advantages
strengthen temptations.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, <i>These temptations were accompanied with a greater
presence and power of Satan</i>. He appeared visibly in them, and was
permitted to touch and hurry the body of Christ, and to depaint and
set forth the glory of the world, doubtless in the most taking way, to
the eye of Christ.</p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, <i>The matter of these temptations</i>, or the things he
tempted Christ to, <i>were great and heinous abominations</i>: a distrust
of providence, a presumption of protection, and a final renunciation
of the worship due to him, and transferring it to the most unworthy
object, God’s professed enemy; and yet were they seconded by the
strongest, most powerful, and most prevailing means, as his present
straits, his infallible assurance of sonship, pleasure, and glory. Where
the matter is weighty, and the medium strong and pressing, there is
the temptation great.</p>

<p>(7.) Seventhly, <i>All these temptations pretended strongly to the advantage
and benefit of Christ</i>, and some of them might seem to be
done without any blame, as to turn stones to bread, to fly in the air.
The more kindness a temptation pretends to us, it is the stronger.</p>

<p>(8.) Eighthly, <i>Satan urged some of them in a daring, provoking
way</i>; ‘If thou be the Son of God?’ as if he had said, I dare thee to
shew thyself what thou pretendest to be. These kind of provocations
are very troublesome to the most modest and self-denying, who can
scarce forbear to do what they are urged unto at such times.</p>

<p>(9.) Ninthly, <i>These temptations seem to be designed for the engagement
of all the natural powers of Christ</i>; his natural appetite in a
design of food; his senses in the most beautiful object, the world in
its glory; the affections, in that which is most swaying, pride, and
delight in extraordinary testimonies of divine power and love, in supporting
him in the air, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(10.) Tenthly, <i>Some of these warranted as duty, and to supply
necessary hunger, others depending upon the security of a promise</i>,
‘He shall give his angels charge,’ &amp;c. The greater appearance of
duty, or warrantableness, is put upon sin, the greater is the temptation.</p>

<p>By these ten particulars may we, as by a standard, judge when any
temptation is great or less.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> 1. <i>Let us then take heed of small temptations, or the
smoother proceedings of Satan, as we would avoid the greater attempts
that are to follow.</i> Where he is admitted to beat out our lusts with
a rod or a staff, he may be suspected to bring the wheel over them at
last, [Isa. xxviii. 27, <i>seq.</i>]</p>

<p>Let us also after our assaults expect more and greater, because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
greatest are last to be looked for. This holds true in three cases.
[1.] In solemn temptations, where Satan fixeth his assaults, there the
utmost rage is drawn out last. [2.] In the continuance and progress
of profession, the further we go from him and the nearer to
God, be sure of the highest measure of his spite. [3.] At the end of
our race: for if he miss his prey then, it is escaped for ever, as a bird
unto its hill.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But some may say, I am but a messenger of sad tidings; and
that by bringing such a report of giants and walled cities, I may make
the hearts of the people to faint.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> I answer; This is bad news only to the sluggish, such as
would go to heaven with ease, and in a fair and easy way; but to the
laborious resolute soldiers of Christ this is no great discouragement:
for, [1.] It doth but tell them of their work, which as they are persuaded
of, so it is in some measure their delight, as well as their
expectation. [2.] It doth but tell them, Satan’s malice and fury,
which they are assured of, and are most afraid of it sometimes, when
it seems to lie idle and as asleep. [3.] It doth tell them that Satan’s
thoughts concerning them are despairing, he fears they are going, or
gone from him. If they were his willing servants, there would be no
hostility of this nature against them.</p>

<p>I have thus compared these special temptations with those wherewith
our Lord Christ was exercised during the forty days. I shall,</p>

<p>Secondly, Compare these temptations of Christ with those that
usually befall his members, in which there is so much suitableness and
agreement both in matter and manner, that it cannot be unuseful to
take notice of it, which will the better appear in instances. First,
then, let us consider the first temptation of Eve: Gen. iii. 6, ‘And
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was
pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise,’ &amp;c.
Here are all the arguments and ways summed up by which Satan prevailed
upon her. It was ‘good for food;’ here he wrought upon the
desire of the natural appetite. It was ‘pleasant to the eyes;’ here he
took the advantage of the external senses. It was ‘to be desired to make
one wise;’ here he inflamed the affections. Let us again call to mind
the general account of temptations in 1 John ii. 16, ‘All that is in the
world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life;’
where the apostle designedly calls all off from a love of the world,
because of the hazard and danger that we lie open unto, from the
things of the world, striking upon and stirring up our lusts; which
he ranks into three general heads, according to the various ways
whereby these outward things do work upon us, in exciting our natural
powers and apprehensions to sinful lustings; and these are so fully agreeing
with those three in Eve’s temptation, that I need not note the parallel.
Let us now cast our eyes upon these temptations, and the suitableness
of Satan’s ways and dealings will immediately appear. When he
tempted Christ to turn stones into bread, there he endeavoured to take
advantage of the ‘lust of the flesh,’ which in 1 John ii., I understand in
a more restrained sense, not for the lustings of corrupt nature, but for
the lustings of the body in its natural appetite, according to that expression
of Christ, ‘The spirit is willing, but the flesh’—or body—‘is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
weak.’ And if we should not so restrain it in this place, the lust of the
flesh would include the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, contrary
to the clear scope of the text, for these are also the lustings of corrupt
nature. When he further tempted him ‘to cast himself down,’ he
pushed him upon ‘the pride of life;’ when he shewed him ‘the kingdoms
of the world, and the glory of them,’ he attempted to gain upon
him by the ‘lust of the eyes.’ From this proportion and suitableness
of temptation to Christ and his members, observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 4. <i>That Satan usually treads in a beaten path, using known
and experienced methods of temptation.</i> It is true, in regard of circumstances,
he useth unspeakable varieties in tempting, and hath many
more devices and juggles than can be reckoned up; yet in the general
he hath digested them into method and order, and the things upon
which he works in us are the same. Thus he walks his round, and
keeps much-what the same track, not only in different persons, but
also in the same men, using the same temptations over and over; and
yet this argues no barrenness of invention or sluggishness in Satan;
but he hath these reasons for it:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, Because the same temptations being suited to human
nature in general, will, with a small variation of circumstance, suit all
men: their inclinations generally answering to one another, as face
answers to face in water.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, These standing methods are famous with him, as
generally powerful and taking; and it can be no wonder if Satan
practise most with these things that have the largest <i>probatum est</i> of
experience to follow them.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, The more experienced he is in any temptation, the
more dexterously and successfully still he can manage it; so that we
may expect him more cunning and able in what he most practiseth.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This may be some satisfaction to those that are apt to think
of themselves and their temptations as Elias did in his persuasion, ‘I
alone am left,’ [1 Kings xix. 14.] Where Satan useth anything of
vigour and fierceness, we are apt to say, ‘None are tempted as we,’
none in like case, we are singular, they are peculiar and extraordinary
temptations, &amp;c.; but it is a mistake. Even that of Solomon may be
applied to these, ‘There is nothing new,’ [Eccles. i. 9,] nor anything
befallen us which others have not undergone before us; and would
but Christians be so careful to observe the way of the serpent upon
their hearts as they might, and so communicative of their experiences
as they ought, the weak and heavy laden would not go so mourning
under such apprehensions as commonly affright them, that none
were ever so tempted as they are. It would be some support at
worst, when the most hellish furies do oppress them, to know that
others before them were in these deeps, and as fearful of being overwhelmed
as themselves, and yet were delivered. The deliverances of
those that have escaped the danger, is ground of hope to those that
are at present under it.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 5. <i>The usual advantages that Satan takes against us is from
our natural appetite, our external senses, or our passions and affections.</i>
All these are usual ways by which Satan works against us, as appears
from what hath been said; neither are any of them so mean and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
contemptible, but that we have cause to fear the power and influence of
them. Hence the Scripture cautions descend to the eyes: ‘Look not
upon the wine when it is red in the cup,’ [Prov. xxiii. 31;] ‘Be sober,
be vigilant,’ &amp;c., [1 Peter v. 8.] The appetite is not so easily kept in,
but that it may prevail to gluttony and drunkenness; and some are
so powerfully carried by this, that they are said ‘to make their bellies
their god,’ [Phil. iii. 19.] Of the power of sense and affection, elsewhere
hath been spoken.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_VIII_3">CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The rise of Christ’s first temptation.—Of Satan’s suiting his temptations
to the conditions of men.—Of tempting men upon the plea of
necessity.—The reasons and cheats of that plea.—His pretences of
friendship in tempting, with the danger thereof.</i></p>


<p>Having thus considered these temptations as they lie before us in
their general prospect, I shall now speak of this first special temptation
in particular, in which—(1.) The rise, or occasion; (2.) The
temptation itself; (3.) The argument by which Satan would enforce
it, are to be distinctly noted.</p>

<p>1. First, <i>As to the rise of it</i>, it is questioned by some why Satan
begins with this first. The cause they assign, in part at least, is from
his first success against Eve, in a temptation about eating, as if this
were the chief and most hopeful arrow in his quiver. But we need
not go so far, when the evangelist is so punctual in setting it down, in
the latter end of the former verse, ‘he was an hungered.’ This the
devil took notice of, and from hence took the rise of his temptation,
that by ‘turning stones to bread,’ for the satisfaction of his present
hunger, he might be induced to make way for the secret stratagems
which he had prepared against him on this occasion. Here I note,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 6. <i>That where Satan hath a design against any, he doth take
the advantage of their condition, and suits his temptation accordingly.</i>
Thus, if men be in poverty, or in the enjoyments of plenty, in sickness
or health, if in afflictions, under wrongs, in discontents, or carried to
advancements and honours, or whatever else may be considerable relating
to them, he observes it, and orders his designs so as to take in
all the advantages that they will afford. That it is his concern and
interest so to do, we may imagine, upon these grounds:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>Our consent must be gained</i>. This he cannot properly
and truly force, but must entice and deceive us to a compliance with
him.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>If our condition speak for him, and lie fair for the
furtherance of any device of his, our consent is upon the matter half
gained</i>. It is much, if so powerful an advocate, as is our present
state, do not influence us to an inclination.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>This doth his work easily and effectually</i>. He more
generally prevails by this course, and with less labour.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This policy of Satan should advantage us by <i>suggesting fit
memorials to us in our expectations of temptation</i>. Though we know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
not all Satan’s thoughts, yet may we know where and how he will
usually make an onset. Our condition will tell us what to look for.
The distressed and afflicted may expect a temptation suited to their
condition, as of murmuring, repining, revenge, distrust, use of indirect
means, despairings, &amp;c. They that have peace and plenty may be
sure they shall be tempted suitably, to pride, boasting, covetousness,
oppression, contempt of others, security, or whatever may be fit to be
ingrafted on that stock. The like may be said of any other different
condition. How fairly are we forewarned, by an observation made
upon Satan’s proceeding upon these advantages, where to expect
him, and how to provide against him.</p>

<p>Let us proceed to a further inquiry, <i>How the devil managed this
advantage of Christ’s hunger</i>. He plainly urgeth him with a necessity
of providing supplies for himself, spreading before him his desire
to eat, and the impossibility of help, in a barren and desolate wilderness:
as if he had said, ‘The want of the body is to be provided for;
nature and religion consents to this; the wilderness affords no help,
ordinary means fail; there is therefore a necessity that some extraordinary
course be taken, therefore turn stones to bread; this is not
unsuitable to the condition and power of him who is the Son of God.’
At this rate he pleads.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 7. Observe then, <i>That Satan usually endeavours to run his
temptations upon the plea of necessity, and from thence to infer a duty</i>.</p>

<p>When he cannot pretend a fair and direct way to irregular practices,
he would break a door and force a way by necessity.</p>

<p>Under this notion of necessity, the devil marshals all those pretences
that seem to be of more than ordinary force, in their usual
prevalencies. Thus he teacheth men to think they are necessitated, if
they be carried by a strong inclination of their own, or if there be an
urgency and provocation from others, or if they be in straits and dangers;
and sometime he goes so high as to teach men that a necessity
is included in the very fabric of their natural principles, by which
they presumptuously excuse themselves in being sinful, because by
nature they are so, and cannot be changed without special grace.
Scarce shall we meet any man with seasonable reproof for his iniquity,
but he will plead such kind of necessities for himself,—I could not
help it; I was strongly carried; or, I was compelled; I must do so, or
else I could not escape such a danger, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The reasons of this policy are these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>He knows that necessity hath a compulsive force</i>, even to
things of otherwise greatest abhorrencies. A treasury of instances is
to be had in famines and besieged places, where it is usual to eat unclean
things, not only creatures that are vile, but even dung and
entrails; nay, so tyrannical is necessity, that it makes inroads into,
and conquests upon nature itself, causing ‘the tender and delicate
woman, which would not adventure the sole of her foot upon the ground
for delicateness and tenderness, to have an evil eye towards the husband
of her bosom, towards her son, and towards her daughter,’ Deut.
xxviii. 56. A like force doth it exercise upon the minds and consciences
of men. It makes them rise up against their light, it engageth
men to lay violent hands upon their own convictions, to stifle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
and extinguish them. How many mournful examples have we of this
kind! How many have apostatized from truth, being terrified by the
urging necessities of danger, contrary to the highest convictions of
conscience!</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>Necessity can do much to the darkening of the understanding,
and change of the judgment, by the strong influence it
hath upon the affections</i>. Men are apt to form their apprehensions
according to the dictates of necessity. What they see to be hazardous,
they are inclinable to judge to be evil. Men in straits not only violate
their reason, but sometime by insensible steps, unknown to themselves,
slide into a contrary judgment of things, directly cross to what
they have believed and professed. Which persuasion they owe not to
any further accession of light, or new discovery of argument; for ofttimes
the same arguments which, in the absence of trouble, they have
contemned as weak, by the appearance of danger, put on another face
and seem strong; but to the prevalency of their fears. And thus
many in all ages have altered their judgments and thoughts, not because
they knew more, but because they feared more.</p>

<p>The like necessities do men form to themselves from exorbitant and
greedy hopes and expectations of a better condition, compared to that
wherein they at present are; and the like influence it hath in the
alteration of their judgments. Let the bishop of Spalato be an
example of this, who loathed the Romish religion first, and in England,
whither he came for refuge, writ against it; but saw a necessity,
from the disappointment of expectation, to change his mind, returned
to Rome again, and persuaded himself that that was true which
he had formerly pronounced false; and so writ against the church of
England, as before he had done against the church of Rome. To
him we may add Ecebolius,<a id="FNanchor_385_385" href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> of whom Socrates reports, that, according
to the various appearings of hazards, he changed his religion several
times. Under Constantine, he was a Christian; under Julian, a
pagan; and under Jovinian, a Christian again.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>Necessity offer’s an excuse, if not a justification, of the
greatest miscarriages</i>.<a id="FNanchor_386_386" href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> Lot offered to expose his daughters to the
raging lust of the Sodomites for the preservation of his angel-strangers,
which surely he would in no wise have done, but that he thought the
present necessity might have excused him. Esau profanely sells
his birthright, but excuseth the matter so, ‘Behold, I am at the
point to die; and what profit shall this birthright do to me?’ Gen.
xxv. 32. Aaron produceth a necessity, from the violent resolves of
the people, in justification of himself in the matter of the golden
calf, ‘Thou knewest that this people are set on mischief,’ [Exod.
xxxii. 22.]</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>Necessity is a universal plea</i>, and fitted to the
conditions of all men in all callings, and under all extravagancies.
The tradesman, in his unlawful gains or overreachings, pleads a necessity
for it from the hardness of the buyer in other things; the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
man pleads a necessity for stealing, and the rich pleads the same
necessity for revenge, and thus it serves all with a pretext.</p>

<p>These considerations, discovering this course so hopeful as to this
design of the devil, he will be sure to put us to this pinch where
he can. But, besides this, we may observe three cheats in this plea
of necessity:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>Sometimes he puts men upon feigning a necessity where
there is none</i>. Saul sacrificed upon a needless supposal that, Samuel
not coming at the time appointed, there was a necessity for him to do
it. He spared also the cattle upon the like pretence, that it was a
necessary provision for sacrifice. And thus would the devil have persuaded
Christ, that there was an absolute necessity to turn stones
to bread, when in truth there was no such need.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Sometimes he puts men upon a necessity of their own
sinful procurement</i>. Herod sware to gratify the daughter of Herodias,
and this is presently pleaded as a necessity for the cutting off John
Baptist’s head. Saul forbade the tasting of meat, and sealed the
penalty by an oath and curse, and this is by and by made a necessity
for the taking away of Jonathan’s life,—who had tasted honey not
knowing his father’s curse,—had not the people rescued him, [1 Sam.
xiv. 24, <i>seq.</i>]</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>Sometime he stretcheth a necessity further than it
ought</i>. He knows that God hath such a regard to real necessities, that
upon that ground he will dispense with his Sabbath and the present
performance of duty. These instances he lays before men, and
endeavours to persuade them, that in like manner God will, upon
a necessity, dispense with sins, as well as with the present opportunity
of service. What a covering, in all ages, men have made of necessity
for their highest outrages and extravagancies, and with what confidence
they have managed such pleas, would be endless to relate.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This must warn us <i>not to suffer ourselves to be imposed
upon by the highest pretences of necessity</i>. Whatever it may dispense
with, as in some cases it will suspend a present service, and warrant
the performance of a duty, besides the common rule and way wherein
it ought ordinarily to be managed, it must never be pleaded to give
warranty to anything in its own nature sinful. Necessity will not
justify lying, stealing, covetousness, adulteries, &amp;c., <i>Ferenda magis
omnis necessitas quam perpetranda aliqua iniquitas</i>.—Aug[ustine.]</p>

<p>Besides, we must be wary in judging what is a necessity. Men are
apt to plead a necessity where there is none; and if we give way to
a facile admittance of excuses of this kind, we shall presently multiply
necessities, and have them to serve us at every turn. Some would
warrant sin by necessity, others would turn off duty and rule by pretending
a necessity where none is; both are to be avoided as snares of
Satan.</p>

<p>Once more, before we dismiss this rise of the temptation of Christ in
hand, let us observe that, in persuading him to turn stones to bread,
he seems to express a great deal of care and tenderness to Christ, with
an invidious reflection upon the love and providence of God: as if he
should say, ‘I see thou art hungry, and this wilderness affords nothing
to eat, and God hath not taken care to spread a table for thee; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
therefore, pitying thy condition, as a friend, advise thee to turn stones
to bread.’</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 8. Note, <i>That Satan manageth his most cruel designs under
the highest pretences of friendship</i>. He did so with Eve, ‘The Lord
knoweth that ye shall be as gods,’ [Gen. iii. 5;] as if he had a greater
regard to them than God himself. He tempted Christ in the mouth
of Peter to ‘spare himself,’ under the show of great kindness, [Mat.
xvi. 22;] and no less are his common pretences to all men. This is
a deep policy, for by this means the mischief intended is the better
concealed, and the less care and provision made against it; and
besides, the affections and desires are stirred up to a hasty embracement
of the motion, and an eager swallowing of the bait.</p>

<p>So great a subtlety is in this manner of dealing, that those who
affect the name of great politicians in the world have learned from
Satan to shew greatest respects and a most friendly countenance to
those whom they most hate and intend to ruin. Thus our Richard
the Third of England constantly dealt with those for whose blood
he lay in wait; and the precepts of Machiavel are fitted to this, that it
is wisdom ‘to hug those whom we desire to destroy.’ Ehud’s present
made way for his dagger, [Judges iii. 22.] Joab’s sword could not so
well have despatched its errand upon Abner, if he had not ushered
it in with a kiss, [2 Sam. xx. 9.]</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This should make us most <i>suspect those temptations that
offer us most kindness and advantage, and such as are most gratifying
to our humours and desires</i>. For can it be imagined in good earnest
that Satan intends us a real good? Can the gifts of enemies pass for
courtesies and favours with any,<a id="FNanchor_387_387" href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> but such as are bewitched into a
blockish madness? Satan is more to be feared when he flatters than
when he rageth; and though such offers may be looked upon by
some as more benign, and less odious temptations, as some kind of
familiar spirits are more kindly treated by some, under the notion of
white devils, yet may we say of them, as Cornelius Agrippa speaks of
some unlawful arts and ways of Thurgia,<a id="FNanchor_388_388" href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> <i>Eò sunt pernitiosiora, qùo
imperitis diviniora</i>, They have the greatest danger that pretend the
highest friendship. Thus much for the rise of the temptation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_IX_3">CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>A particular consideration of the matter of the first temptation, what
Satan aimed at in bidding him turn stones into bread.—Of Satan’s
moving us to things good or lawful.—The end of such a motion.—How
to know whether such motions are from Satan or the Spirit.—What
to do in case they be from Satan.—Of his various aims in
one temptation.—What they are, and of his policy therein.—Of his
artificial contrivement of motions to make one thing infer another.</i></p>


<p>Next follows the temptation itself, ‘Command that these stones be
made bread.’ There is no great difficulty in the words. The Greek
indeed hath a remarkable suitableness to the supposition, on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
Satan insists, taking Christ to be the Son of God. It is very pertinently
spoken, ‘Say or speak’—εἶπε—that these stones be made bread;
for if God speak, it must be done.</p>

<p>It is not worth the while to insist upon so small a variety of expression
as is betwixt this evangelist, who hath it ‘these stones,’ and Luke,
who speaks it in the singular number, ‘this stone;’ for besides that,
as some suppose, this expression of Luke might, for anything that
appears to the contrary, be Satan’s lowering his request to one stone,
when Christ had denied to turn many into bread upon his first asking;
<i>this</i> one stone in Luke, taken collectively for the whole heap, will
signify as much as <i>these</i> stones in Matthew; or the phrase ‘these
stones,’ in Matthew, by an imitation of a common Hebraism, may be
no more but one of these stones, or this stone, as it is in Luke; as it
is said, Jephthah was buried in the cities of Gilead, that is, in one of
the cities.<a id="FNanchor_389_389" href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<p>The thing urged was the turning or changing the form of a creature,
which is a work truly miraculous and wonderful, and such as
had neither been unsuited to the power of Christ, nor unlawful in
itself. It is from hence justly questioned where the sting of this suggestion
lay, or in what point was the temptation couched.</p>

<p>(1.) First, It was not in <i>the unlawfulness or sinfulness of the thing
mentioned</i>. For Christ did as much as would amount to all this when
he turned water into wine, and when he fed multitudes by a miraculous
multiplication of a few loaves and fishes.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>It was not unsuitable to his condition, as hungry</i>;
for so it seemed a duty to provide for himself, and which Satan took
for granted.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Neither seemed it <i>any derogation to his power and
divine nature, but rather an advantage and fit opportunity to give a full
proof of it</i>, to the stopping of Satan’s mouth for ever.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these, there was poison and malignity enough in
the suggestion, and under these green leaves of plausible pretences lay
hid many snakes. For [1.] By this was he secretly tempted to admit
of a doubting of the truth of the divine testimony, lately declaring
him to be the Son of God. [2.] As also further to question his
Father’s providence and love; [3.] and unnecessarily to run out of the
ordinary way of supply, and to betake himself to indirect means or
extraordinary courses. [4.] And all this to the abuse and undervaluing
of his power, in prostituting it to Satan’s direction or persuasion;
and the devil had gained a considerable advantage if he could have
prevailed with him to do such a thing by his instigation. [5.] It may
be he further thought this might entice to a high esteem of himself,
and so make way for a vain ostentation of his power and interest in
God. All or most of these seem to be the design that the devil was
driving forward. Several things are hence observable.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 9. <i>That where Satan doth not judge it his present interest to
suggest to us things in their own nature sinful, he will move us to things
good in themselves, in hopes thereby to lead us into evil.</i> This way of
tempting is from a more refined policy than downright motions to sin,
and doubtless it is less suspected, and consequently more taking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
The evils that Satan would introduce by this method are such as
these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, Sometime when he tempts us to that which is good, it
is that he might <i>affright us from it</i>. His approbation is enough to
put a discredit and disgraceful suspicion upon anything. Such a
design had he when he gave testimony for Christ, ‘that he was the
Son of God,’ Mat. viii. 29; or for the apostles, that they were the
‘servants of the most high God,’ Acts xvi. 17. It was not his intention
to honour him or them by bearing them witness, but to bring
them under suspicion and trouble.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>There are a great many ways to miscarry in a lawful
action</i>, either by propounding bad ends, or by failures in the manner
of performance, or by a misimprovement of the whole. These miscarriages,
and the possibility and probability of them, Satan carries in
his mind; yet doth he not at first propound them, but moving us unto
the thing, he hath an expectation that we will slide into them of ourselves,
or be inclined by some suitable touches of suggestion upon our
minds, together with the tendency or improvableness of the thing or
action to such evils as are properly consequent to it. Satan did not
here tempt Christ to these sinful ends directly, but to an action which
he hoped might insensibly produce them.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Another evil hereby aimed at is <i>the hindrance of a
greater good, not only as a diversion to turn us off a better or more
profitable occasion, but also as an unseasonable interruption of something
at present more concerning us</i>. Thus he makes the suggestion
of good things the hindrance of prayer or hearing.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> Some will say, This is a perplexing case, that in things good
or lawful in themselves, men should be in such dangers, and will
thereupon desire to know how they may distinguish Satan’s contrivances
and motions from those that have no dependence upon him, or
are from the Spirit of God?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> In answer to this:—</p>

<p>[1.] Let us, when we fear thus to be circumvented, look well <i>to what
impressions are upon our spirit when we are moved to what may be
lawful</i>. For together with the motion, if it be Satan’s, we shall find
either a corrupt reason and end privately rising up in our mind, or we
may observe that our hearts are out of order and perversely inclined.
This is oft unseen to ourselves. When the disciples moved Christ to
bring down ‘fire from heaven,’ if they had considered the present revengeful
selfish frame of their spirits, which our Lord tells them they
were ignorant of, they might easily have known that the motion had
proceeded from Satan.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>The concurrent circumstances of the thing or action are
to be seriously weighed</i>, for from thence we may take a right measure
of the conveniency or inconveniency of the proceeding in it. What is
from Satan it will be either unseasonable as to the time, place, and
person, or some other thing will appear that may give a discovery. As
here Christ refuseth to turn stones to bread, because not only the way
and manner of the proposal doth sufficiently lay open the design, but
also the circumstances of Christ’s condition at that time shewed the
motion to be unseasonable and inconvenient; for if Satan had urged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
the necessity of it for the satisfaction of his hunger, Christ could have
answered, that the experience that he had of God’s support for forty
days together, was sufficient to engage him to rely yet further upon
him. If he had urged further, that by this means he might have had
a full proof of God’s love and care, or of his sonship, it was at hand to
tell him that it was needless to seek a further evidence when God had
given one so full a little before. If again he had pleaded it to have
been a useful occasion to give a testimony of his power to the satisfaction
of others, he could have told him that it had been impertinent
to have done it then, when he was in the wilderness, where none could
have the benefit of it. So that nothing Satan could have propounded
as a reason for that miracle, but it might have been repelled from a
consideration of his present condition.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> The instruction that may be gathered from this is, <i>that we
must not entertain thoughts of doing lawful things without a due inquiry
into the temper of our own hearts, and a full consideration of all
circumstances round about, with the probable tendencies and consequences
of it</i>.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But, may some say, if I judge such a motion to be a thing
lawful, which doth proceed from Satan, what am I to do?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I answer, [1.] Consider whether the good be necessary or
not. If it be necessary, it is a duty and not to be forborne, only the
abuses are to be watched against and avoided.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, If it be a duty, consider whether it be seasonable or
unseasonable, necessary or not, as to the present time; if it be not, it
may be suspended, and a fitter opportunity waited for.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, If it be only lawful and not necessary, we ought to
abstain from it wholly, after the example of David, Ps. xxxix. 2, who
‘abstained even from good,’ that is, from lawful bemoanings of himself
or complainings against Absalom, that had rebelled against him;
because it was not necessary, and, the circumstances of his condition
considered, very dangerous, lest vent and way being given, he might
have been easily drawn to speak passionately or distrustfully against
God, and foolishly against providences.</p>

<p>That the thing unto which Satan moved Christ was lawful, hath
been noted. Next, let us consider <i>what end Satan might propound to
himself in this motion</i>, and we shall see, as hath been said, that he
did not so narrow and contract his design as that only one thing took
up his intentions, but several. Hence have we this observation:—</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 10. <i>That in one single temptation Satan may have various
aims and designs.</i></p>

<p>Temptation is a complicated thing, a many-headed monster. Satan
hath always many things in his eye.</p>

<p>[1.] First, In every temptation there is <i>a direct and principal
design, a main thing that the devil would have</i>.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, There are several things <i>subservient to the main
design</i>, as steps, degrees, or means leading to it; the lesser still making
way for the greater. If Satan design murder, he lays the foundation
of his work in inward grudgings and hatreds; next he gives provocations,
by reproachful words, or disdainful carriages and behaviours,
as our Saviour notes in the expressions of <i>raca</i> and <i>fool</i>, Mat. v. 22,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
and so by degrees enticeth on to murder. The like we may observe
in the lusts of uncleanness, and other things.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Besides these there are usually <i>reserves, something in
ambushment to watch our retreats</i>; for Satan considers what to do in
case we repel and refuse his motion, that so he may not altogether
labour in vain. A contrary extreme watcheth those that fly from a
temptation; pride, security, self-confidence, and boasting are ready to
take them by the heel. So truly may it be said of Satan, that he
knoweth the way that we take: if we go forward, he is there; if backward,
we may also perceive him; on the left hand, he is at work; and
on the right hand, he is not idle. All these we may particularly see
in this temptation in hand. He had a main design, of which more
presently; he prepares means and seconds to help it forward; such
were those pleas of necessity and conveniency which the hunger
and want of Christ did furnish him withal, and there wanted not
the reserves of presumption and self-neglect in case he resisted the
motion.</p>

<p>The reasons of this policy are these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>When Satan tempts, he is not certain of his prevalency,
even when the probabilities are the greatest</i>; and therefore doth he
provide himself with several things at once, that if the tempted party
nauseate one thing, there may be another in readiness that may please
his palate. God gives this advice to the spiritual seedsman, ‘In the
morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand;
for thou knowest not what shall prosper, whether this or that,’ [Eccles.
xi. 6.] Satan, that seedsman of the tares, imitates this; and because
he knows not what shall prosper, therefore doth he use variety.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>Where many things are at once designed, it is a
hundred to one they will not all return empty</i>. It is much if many
snares miss; he that hath broken one or two, may not only be enticed
with a third temptation—as being either wearied out with the assaults,
or made pliable with the allurements of the former, but may also sit
down secure, as having, in his supposal, passed all the danger, and so
unawares fall into an unseen or unsuspected trap.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This may [1.] by way of caution, assure us that we have no
cause to think that all fear is over, when we have avoided the more
obvious and conspicuous designments of a temptation, but rather to
suspect some further train than we yet have discovered. [2.] That
there is a necessity for us to be circumspect every way, and, Janus-like,
to have an eye before and behind, that we may make timely discoveries
of what Satan intends against us.</p>

<p>As we have taken a view of the various designments of Satan in
one temptation, so it is also remarkable, that these various ways of
his in this temptation, do give strength one to another, and have as
close a connexion as stones in an arch. Christ was pleased to commend
the wisdom of the unjust steward, though he intended not the
least approbation of his dishonesty. So we may turn aside and observe
the cunning artifice of the devil, in the management of this argument
against Christ, which is to this purpose, as if he had thus proceeded:
‘If thou art the Son of God,’ as the voice from heaven lately testified,
it can be no inconvenience, but every way an advantage to give a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
further proof of it. Thy present condition of want and hunger seem
to contradict it; for how strange and unbeseeming is it for the Son of
God to be in such straits! yet if thou beest what thou sayest thou art,
it is easy for thee to help thyself. God, that made the world of nothing,
by the power of his command, can much more change the forms of
things that are made already; it is but speaking, and these stones
that are before thee will be turned into bread; and besides that, in so
doing thou mayest seasonably vindicate thyself from the eclipse of
thy present condition. Necessity and duty—for it is duty to supply
the want of the body, which cannot be supported without its proper
nourishment—compel thee unavoidably to it, except thou fearest not
to contract the guilt of self-destruction, especially seeing I do not urge
thee to provide delicacies, but only bread, and such as is needful to
keep in the lives of the poorest men, in the poorest manner.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 11. Hence note, <i>Satan in driving on a temptation, useth such
an artificial contrivement of motives and things, that still one doth
infer another, one strengthens another</i>. Temptations are like a screw,
which if once admitted, will improve its first hold to draw in all the
rest. By these arts doth Satan, like a cunning serpent, wriggle himself
into the affections of men.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_X_3">CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s chief end in this temptation; his skill in making the means
to sin plausible.—The reasons of that policy, with his art therein.—Men’s
ignorance his advantage.—Of the differences of things propounded
to our use.</i></p>


<p>The various aims of Satan, and their close dependence one upon
another, having contributed to us their several observations, it remains
that we ask after the main and chief thing that Satan principally
intended. And to make way to this, it must be noted, that in grand
temptations especially, the main design of Satan comprehends these
two: the chief end, and the chief means conducing to that end. About
these, some authors conjecture variously, whose differences we have no
great occasion to mention, seeing the text gives so great a satisfaction
in this matter.</p>

<p>1. For first, The main end of Satan we have not obscurely expressed
to us in these words, ‘If thou be the Son of God,’ which if we compare
with Mat. iii. 17, ‘This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,’
we shall easily apprehend that here Satan doth but echo to that voice
which came down from heaven; as he did with Eve. God had said,
of the tree in the midst of the garden, ye shall not eat, [Gen. iii. 3.]
Satan, having as it were the sound of this yet in his ears, in a clear
reference to it saith, ‘Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat?’ ver. 1.
So here is also an evident respect to God’s testimony concerning Christ,
as if he had said, ‘Hath God said thou art his Son? If thou beest
indeed such as he testified, give some proof of it,’ &amp;c. By which it
appears that his design was to undermine this testimony, or some way
or other to defeat it. Neither need it pass for an objection against this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
that Satan doth not directly mention his doubt or distrust, nor positively
suggest to Christ a questioning or misbelief of his sonship, for it was
not suitable to his policy so to lay open his main end. That must
have been expected afterward, as the last in execution, if it had taken
effect, though it were first in intention.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, The chief means by which he would have brought
this end about, may be understood from Christ’s answer to the temptation;
for it cannot but be imagined that Christ knew the bottom of
Satan’s policy, and that his answer must fully confront the means by
which Satan endeavoured to ensnare him. His answer was, ‘Man
lives not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God.’ If we can then come to a certain understanding of
this scripture, which is not difficult, we shall evidently know the mind
of the temptation, to which this is a direct answer.</p>

<p>These words are cited out of Deut. viii. 3, which some interpret to
this sense,<a id="FNanchor_390_390" href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> as if Christ had said, Man hath not only a life of the body—which
is mentioned<a id="FNanchor_391_391" href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> by bread—to look after, but another life of the
soul, which is of so great concernment, that the bodily life is to be
neglected, rather than that of the soul to be endangered. This is a
truth in itself, but is apparently besides the meaning of Deut. viii.
Neither doth it afford so full and particular an answer as doubtless
Christ intended. But let us consider the text, and we shall find more
in it; for Moses first sets down God’s dealing with Israel in the wilderness,
in that he suffered them to hunger, and took from them the
ordinary means of life, which, as the latter part of the verse shews, is
to be understood of ordinary bread; and then to supply that want, he
fed them by an extraordinary means, such as they had never heard of
before; this was by manna. Next he makes an inference from this
way of God’s proceeding, improving this particular to a general rule,
‘That he might make thee know that man lives not by bread only,
but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth
man live;’ which is clearly of this import, that man lives not by ordinary
means only, but that God can provide for his life in an extraordinary
way, by appointing anything to that end, through his mighty
and powerful word and good pleasure. So that things never so unusual,
or unfit in themselves for nourishment, will become strengthening
to us, if he shall give out his command. Christ then applying
this in this sense, did, as it were, thus say to Satan, ‘Though I want
ordinary means of life, which is bread, yet I know God can make anything
which he pleaseth to nourish me instead of it. So that I will
not cast off a dependence upon the providence of God in this strait,
and without warrant run to an extraordinary course for supply.’
Hence it is evident that to bring about his main end, which
was to distrust of his relation to God, he used this means, that by
reason of his strait in the failure of ordinary supply, he should
distrust providence, and without warrant provide for himself.
Observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 12. <i>That where Satan carries on a main design and end, he
bestows most of his pains and skill in rendering the means to that end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
plausible and taking.</i> The end is least in mention, and the means in
their fit contrivance takes up most of his art and care. The reasons
whereof are these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>The end is apparently bad, so that it would be a contradiction
to his design to mention it</i>. It is the snare and trap itself,
which his wisdom and policy directs him to cover. His ultimate end
is the destruction of the soul. This he dare not openly avouch to the
vilest of men; he doth not say to them, ‘Destroy your souls,’ ‘Bring
eternal miseries upon yourselves,’ but only tempts them to that which
will bring this misery upon them; and as for those intermediate ends,
which are the formal acts of sin, he useth also a kind of modesty in
their concealment. He doth not usually say, Go and murder, or, Commit
adultery; but rather puts them upon ways or means that will
bring them up to those iniquities, except that he sometime have to
deal with those that are so hardened in sin, that they make a sport to
do wickedly, and then he can more freely discover his ends to such in
the temptation.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, The means to such wicked ends have not only an
innate and natural tendency in themselves, which are apt to sway and
bias men that way, but are also capable <i>of artificial improvement, to
a further enticement to the evils secretly intended; and these require
the art and skill for the exact suiting and fitting of them</i>. The end
cannot be reached without the means, and means so ordered, without
the aid of grace, will scarce miss of the end.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, The means are capable of <i>a varnish and paint</i>. He
can make a shift to set them off and colour them over, that the proper
drift of them cannot easily be discovered; whereas the ends to which
these lead cannot receive, at least so easily with some, such fair shows.
It is far easier to set off company-keeping, with the pleasurable pretences
of necessity or refreshing divertisement, than to propound direct
drunkenness, the thing to which company-keeping tends, under such
a dress.</p>

<p><i>Query.</i> If it be demanded, How and by what arts he renders the
means so plausible? I shall endeavour a satisfaction to that query,
by shewing the way that Satan took to render the means he made use
of in this temptation, plausible to Christ, which were these:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, He represents it as <i>a harmless or lawful thing in itself</i>.
Who can say it had been sinful for the Son of God to have turned
stones into bread, more than to turn water into wine?</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He gives the motion a further pretext of <i>advantage
or goodness</i>. He insinuated that it might be a useful discovery of his
sonship, and a profitable supply against hunger.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, He seems also to put <i>a necessity upon it</i>, that other
ways of help failing, he must be constrained so to do, or to suffer
further want.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, He forgets not to tell him that to do this was but
<i>suitable to his condition</i>, and that it was a thing well becoming the
Son of God to do a miracle.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, He doth urge it at the rate of <i>a duty</i>, and that being
in hunger and want, it would be a sinful neglect not to do what he
could and might for his preservation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>The same way doth he take in other temptations; in some cases
pleading all, in some most of these things, by which the means conducing
thereunto may seem plausible. If he presents to men occasions
of sinning, he will tell them ordinarily that they may lawfully adventure
upon them, that they are harmless, nay, of advantage, as tending
to the recreating of the spirits and health of the body; yea, that it is
necessary for them to take such a liberty, and that in doing so, they
do but what others do that profess religion. And often he hath such
advantage from the circumstances of the thing, and the inclination
of our heart, that he makes bold to tell us it is no less than duty.
Such did the outrage of Demetrius seem to him, when he considered
how much his livelihood did depend upon the Diana of the Ephesians.
Paul’s zeal made him confident that persecution of Christians was his
duty; neither is there anything which can pretend to any zeal, advantage,
or colourable ground, but presently it takes the denomination
of duty.</p>

<p>If any wonder that such poor and shallow pretences are not seen
through by all men, they may know that this happens from a fourfold
ignorance:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>From an ignorance of the thing itself</i>. How easily may
they be imposed upon, who know not the nature or the usual issues of
things! As children are deluded to put a value upon a useless or
hurtful trifle, so are men deceived and easily imposed upon in what
they do not understand. And for this cause are sinners compared to
birds, who are easily enticed with the bait proposed to their view as
profitable and good for them, because they know not the snare that
lies laid under it. This ignorance causing the mistake mentioned, is
not only a simple ignorance, but also that ignorance which owes its
rise to a wilful and perverse disposition,—for there are some that are
willingly ignorant,—doth often lay those open to a delusion, who,
through prepossession or idleness, will not be at pains to make full
inquiries.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, This also comes to pass from <i>an ignorance of our
spirits</i>: for while we either engage in the things proposed by Satan
upon the general warranty of a good intention, or that we have no
evil meaning in it, we are kept from a discovery of the intended design.
Hence Paul saw nothing, in his persecuting the church of God, of
what Satan aimed at; or while upon the pretence of a good intention,
our secret corrupt principles do indeed move us underhand to
any undertaking, we are as little apt to see the ends of Satan in
what he propounds to us. Jehu and the disciples, Luke ix. 55,
pretending a zeal for God, but really carried on by their own furious
tempers, did as little as others see what the devil was doing with
them.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, The means of a temptation are rendered less suspicious,
from <i>an ignorance of the circumstances and concomitants that
do attend them</i>.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, As also from <i>an ignorance of our own weakness and
inclination</i>. While we are confident of greater strength to resist than
indeed we have, of a greater averseness than is in us to the evil suspected,
we contemn the danger of the means as below us, and so grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
bold with the occasions of iniquity, as pretending no hazard or danger
to us.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> <i>This may teach us a piece of wisdom in the imitation of
the devil.</i> We see his malice appears in the bloody and destructive
aims or intendments which he discovers against us, but his skill and
cunning in a suitable disposal and ordering of the means. So should
we learn to employ all our care and watchfulness about those plausible
ways or introductions to sin that Satan puts in our hand; and as his
eager desire of gaining his end makes him industrious about the
offering of means fit to compass it, so our fear of his design and end
should make us jealous of every overture propounded to us. They
that from wilfulness or neglect shall admit the means of evil, cannot
expect to avoid the evil to which they lead, or if they may, unexpectedly,
be rescued from the end, while they use the means,—by
grace interposing, as between the cup and the lip,—it is no thanks
to them, and often they come not off so clear, but that some lameness
or other sticks by them.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> I may suspect this will be retorted back as an advice scarce
practicable: for if all means leading to sin are to be avoided, then
can we use nothing, but rather, as the apostle saith in another case,
‘we must go out of the world,’ [1 Cor. v. 10,] seeing everything may
lead to evil?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> I answer, We are not by any command of God put into any
such strait. Things that are or may be improveable against us, may
be used by us with due care and watchfulness; yet all things are not
alike neither, for we must look upon things under a threefold consideration.</p>

<p>[1.] First, If that which is propounded or laid before us as a
means to sin, be in itself sinful, the refusal of both is an undoubted
duty.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, We must look upon things under the consideration
of the suspiciousness which they carry with them of a further evil.
Some circumstances, or postures of an opportunity and occasion offered,
are of such a threatening aspect, that they fairly warn us to hold off.
To keep company with a friend may be admitted, when yet that
society in a suspicious place, as tavern or whore-house, is to be
avoided.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, We must further consider things as we are free or
engaged to them, and accordingly where there is appearance of
danger or the fear of it, we must keep at a distance, if we are engaged
to such things, either by the obligation of the law of nature, or
lawful calling, or command of God, or unavoidable providence, or
relation. Where these ties are upon us, we cannot avoid the thing
or action, but are the more concerned to take heed of being overreached
or overtaken by them.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XI_3">CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of the temptation to distrust upon the failure of ordinary means.—Of
the power of that temptation, and the reasons of its prevalency.—Of
unwarrantable attempts for relief, with the causes thereof.—Of
waiting on God, and keeping his way.—In what cases a particular
mercy is to be expected.</i></p>


<p>I have particularly insisted upon the aims of Satan in this temptation
in their variety, and also the cunning connexion and coherences of
them. I have also singled out his chief design. I am now in the
last place to present you with the suitableness and respects that the
subordinate means carry to the principal, and that proportion which
may be found in all these to the end designed by them.</p>

<p>The chief means in reference to the end designed, was a distrust of
providence, and the subordinate means to bring on that distrust, was
the failure of ordinary means of supply: for so he endeavoured to
improve his hunger and want in the wilderness, as a manifest neglect
of providence towards him, for which, as he tacitly suggests, there
was no ground to wait or rely upon it any further, but to betake himself
to another course. Hence note,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 13. <i>That the failure of ordinary means of help is by Satan
improved as his special engine to bring men to a distrust of providence,
and from thence to an unwarrantable attempt for their relief in
an extraordinary way.</i></p>

<p>That the failure of ordinary and usual supplies hath by the devil’s
subtlety brought a distrust of providence, and run men beyond all
hopes of help, is a thing commonly and notoriously known. When
men are afflicted, and brought unto unusual straits, and the ordinary
ways of relief are out of sight, they are soon tempted to distrust God
and man; and to conclude they are cut off, and that their ‘hope is
perished,’ and that ‘their eye shall no more see good.’ David distressed,
proclaims ‘all men liars:’ concludes that he should at last
‘be cut off,’ Ps. cxvi. 11, xxxi. 22. Jonah, in the whale’s belly,
thought that all hope was gone, and that he was cast out of God’s
sight, chap. ii. 4. The church of Israel in captivity, ‘forgot prosperity,’
notwithstanding the promise of deliverance after seventy years,
and thought no less than that ‘her hope and strength was perished,’
Lam. iii. 18. And from the scriptures mentioned, we may also see
the strength and prevalency of the temptation, especially when it is
reduced to particulars. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>It is not a thing altogether of no weight that such a
temptation should prevail against such persons</i>; as David and Jonah,
and the whole church of Israel, that the manifold experiences that
some of them have had of God’s faithfulness in delivering, and the
seasonableness of help at times of greatest hazard, the particular promises
that all of them have had—how dismal and black soever things
have seemed—have given the fullest assurances imaginable, that what
he had spoken should certainly be performed; the gracious qualifications
of such persons as eminently holy and skilled in the duties of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
trust, and in the ways of providence, and the special advantage which
some of them, as prophets, have had above others, to enable them to
improve that skill, experience, knowledge, and grace, to a firm adherence
to such special promises: that all these things should not be
sufficient to keep them off distrust, though at present the ways of deliverence
were hid from them, seems strange.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, It is wonderful <i>to what a height such a prevailing
temptation hath carried some of them</i>. David seems to be a little
outrageous, and did upon the matter call God ‘a liar,’ when he said,
‘All men are liars;’ which however that some interpret<a id="FNanchor_392_392" href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> as if it had
been David’s trust in God, and his confident avouchment of his
enemies’ prognostications of his ruin, to be but lies, and that this he
spake from his firm belief of the promise, ‘I believed, therefore have
I spoken;’ yet the acknowledgment of his ‘haste,’ which, compared
with Ps. xxxi. 22, is declared as his weakness, will force us to conclude
it an ingenuous confession of his distrust at the first, when
he was greatly afflicted, though he recovered himself afterwards
to a belief of the promise; and that in that distemper he plainly reflected
upon Samuel, and calls the promises of God given by him ‘a
very lie.’</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, It is strange also <i>that present instances of God’s providences
working out unexpected deliverances should not relieve the
hearts of his saints from the power of such distrust</i>; that when they
see God is not unmindful of them, but doth hear them in what they
feared, they should still retain in their minds the impression of an
unbelieving apprehension; and not rather free themselves from their
expectations of future ruin by concluding, that he that hath and doth
deliver will also yet deliver. David had this thought in his heart,
that he should ‘one day perish by the hand of Saul,’ 1 Sam. xxvii. 1,
even then when God had so remarkably rescued him from Saul, and
forced Saul not only to acknowledge his sin in prosecuting him, but
also to declare his belief of the promise concerning David. See chap.
xxvi. One would have expected that this should have been such a
demonstration of the truth of what had been promised, that he should
cast out all fear; and yet, contrariwise, this pledge of God’s purpose
to him is received by a heart strongly prepossessed with misgiving
thoughts, and he continues to think that for all this Saul would one
day destroy him.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>The pangs of this distrust are also so remarkable,
that after they have been delivered, and have found that the event hath
not answered their fears, they have in the review of their carriage
under such fears, recounted this their weakness among other remarkable
things</i>, thereby shewing the unreasonableness of their unbelief, and
their wonder that God should pass by so great a provocation, and
notwithstanding so unexpectedly deliver them. David in the places
before cited was upon a thankful acknowledgment of God’s love and
wonderful kindness, which be thought he could not perform without
leaving a record of his strange and unworthy distrust; as if he had
said, ‘So greatly did I sin, and so unsuitably did I behave myself,
that I then gave off, and concluded all was lost.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span></p>

<p>To open this a little further, I shall add the reasons why Satan
strikes in with such an occasion as the want of means to tempt to
distrust, which are these:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>Such a condition doth usually transport men beside themselves</i>;
puts them, as it were, into an ecstacy, and by a sudden rapture
of astonishment and fear, forceth them beyond their settled thoughts
and purposes. This David notes as the ground of his inconsiderate
rash speaking: ‘It was my haste,’ I was transported, &amp;c. Now as
passion does not only make men speak what otherwise they would
not, but also to put bad interpretations upon actions and things
beyond what they will bear, and hasten men to resolves exceedingly
unreasonable; so doth this state of the heart, under an amazement
and surprise of fear, give opportunity to Satan to put men to injurious
and unrighteous thoughts of the providence of God, and by such ways
to alienate their minds from the trust which they owe him.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Sense is a great help to faith</i>. Faith then must
needs be much hazarded when sense is at a loss or contradicted, as
usually it is in straits.</p>

<p>That faith doth receive an advantage by sense, cannot be denied.
To believe what we see, is easier than to believe what we see not; and
that in our state of weakness and infirmity God doth so far indulge
us, that by his allowance we may take the help of our senses, is evident
by his appointment of the two sacraments, where by outward visible
signs our faith may be quickened to apprehend the spiritual benefits
offered. Thomas, resolving to suspend his belief till he were satisfied
that Christ was risen, by the utmost trial that sense could give,
determining not to credit the testimony of the rest of the disciples till
by putting his finger into his side he had made himself more certain,
Christ not only condescended to him, but also pronounceth his approbation
of his belief, accepting it, that he had believed because he had
seen. But when outward usual helps fail us, our sense, being not
able to see afar off, is wholly puzzled and overthrown. The very
disappearing of probabilities gives so great a shake to our faith that it
commonly staggers at it; and therefore was it given as the great commendation
of Abraham’s faith, that he, notwithstanding the unlikelihood
of the thing, ‘staggered not at the promise;’ noting thereby how
extraordinary it was in him at that time to keep up against the contradiction
of sense, and how usual it is with others to be beaten off
all trust by it. It is no wonder to see that faith, which usually called
sense for a supporter, to fail when it is deprived of its crutch. And
he that would a little understand what disadvantage this might prove
to a good man when sense altogether fails his expectation, he may
consider with himself in what a case Thomas might have been if
Christ had refused to let him see his side, and to thrust his finger into
the print of the nails. In all appearance, had it been so, he had gone
away confirmed in his unbelief.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>Though faith can act above sense, and is employed
about things not seen, yet every saint at all times doth not act his
faith so high</i>. Christ tells us that to believe where a man hath not
had the help of sight and sense, is noble and blessed, John xx. 29; yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
withal, he hints it to be rare and difficult: ‘he that hath not seen,
and yet hath believed,’ implies that it is but one amongst many that
doth so, and that it is the conquest of a more than ordinary difficulty.
Hence it is, that to love God when he kills, to believe when means fail,
are reckoned among the high actings of Christianity.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>When sense is nonplussed, and faith fails, the soul
of man is at a great loss</i>. Having nothing to bear it up, it must needs
sink; but having something to throw it down, besides its own propensity
downward to distrust, it hath the force of so great a disappointment
to push it forward; and such bitterness of spirit, heightened by
the malignant influence of Satan, that with a violence like the angel’s
throwing a millstone into the sea, it is cast into the bottom of such
depths of unbelief, that the knowledge of former power and extraordinary
providences cannot keep it from an absolute denial of the
like for the future. Israel in the wilderness, when they came to the
want of bread, though they acknowledged he ‘clave the rock,’ and gave
them water in the like strait, yet so far did their hearts fail of that due
trust in the power and mercy of God, which might have been expected,
that though they confessed the one, they as distrustfully question and
deny the other. ‘He clave the rock, but can he provide flesh? can he
give bread?’ [Ps. lxxviii. 20.] Strange unbelief, that sees and acknowledgeth
omnipotency in one thing, and yet denies it in another!</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, <i>Providence hath been an old question</i>. It is an atheism
that some have been guilty of, to deny that God ordereth all affairs
relating to his children here below, who yet have not so fully extinguished
their natural impressions as to dare to deny the being of God. That
God is, they confess, but withal they think that he ‘walketh in the
circuit of heaven,’ and as to the smaller concerns of men, neither doth
good nor evil. This being an old error, to which most are but too
inclinable; and the more because such things are permitted—as the
punishment of his children, and their trials, while others have all
their heart can wish—as seem scarce consistent with that love and
care which men look for from him to his servants, they are apt enough
to renew the thoughts of that persuasion upon their minds—for which
the failure of ordinary ways of help seems to be a high probability—that
he keeps himself unconcerned, and therefore there seems to be no
such cause of reliance upon him. The psalmist so expresseth that
truth, ‘Men shall say, Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth,’
[Ps. lviii. 11;] that it is discovered to be a special retrievement of it,
by many and signal convincing evidences, from that distrust of God
and his providences that men usually slide into upon their observation
of the many seeming failures of outward means of help.</p>

<p>Secondly, The other branch of the observation, <i>that from a distrust
of providence he endeavours to draw them to an unwarrantable attempt
for their relief</i>, is as clear as the former. Sarah being under a distrust
of the promise for a son, because of her age, gave her handmaid
to Abraham, that in that way, the promise seeming to fail, she might
obtain children by her, Gen. xvi. 2. David, because of the many and
violent pursuits of Saul, not only distrusted the promise, thinking he
might ‘one day perish’ by him, but resolves to provide for his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
safety by a speedy escape into the land of the Philistines, 1 Sam. xxvii.
1; a course which, as appears by the temptations and evils he met
with there, was altogether unwarrantable. That from a distrust men
are next put upon unwarrantable attempts, is clear from the following
reasons:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>The affrightment which is bred by such distrusts of providences
will not suffer men to be idle</i>. Fear is active, and strongly
prompts that something is to be done.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Yet such is <i>the confusion of men’s minds in such a
case, that though many things are propounded, in that hurry of thoughts
they are deprived usually of a true judgment and deliberation</i>, so that
they are oppressed with a multitude of thoughts, as David on the like
occasion takes notice, ‘In the multitude of my thoughts within me,’
&amp;c., [Ps. xciv. 19;] and, as he expresseth the case of seamen in a
storm, ‘they are at their wits’ end.’</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>The despairing grievance of spirit</i> makes them take
that which comes next to hand, as a drowning man that grasps a twig
or straw, though to no purpose.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Being once turned off their rock, and the true stay of
the promise of God for help, <i>whatever other course they take must
needs be unwarrantable</i>. If they once be out of the right way, they
must needs wander, and every step they take must of necessity be
wrong.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, <i>Satan is so officious in an evil thing</i>, that seeing any in
this condition, he will not fail to proffer his help; and in place of
God’s providence, to set some unlawful shift before them.</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, And so much the rather do men close in with such
overtures, because a <i>sudden fit of passionate fury doth drive them, and
out of a bitter kind of despite and crossness</i>—as if they meditated a revenge
against God for their disappointment—<i>they take up a hasty
wilful resolve to go that way that seems most agreeable to their passion</i>,
saying with king Joram, ‘What wait we upon the Lord any longer
for?’ [2 Kings vi. 33.] We will take such a course, let come on us
what will.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> The service which the observation, well digested, may perform
for us, is very fully contained in an advice which David gives on
the like occasion, Ps. xxxvii. 34, which is this, ‘Wait on the Lord,
and keep his way.’ Failures of ordinary means should not fill us with
distrust, neither then should we run out of God’s way for help. He
that would practise this must have these three things which are comprehended
in it:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>He must have full persuasions of the power and promise
of God</i>. I do not mean the bare hearsay that God hath promised
to help, and that he is able to deliver, but these truths must be
wrought upon the heart to a full assurance of them, and then we
must keep our eye upon them; for if ever we lose the sight of this,
when troubles beset us, our heart will fail us, and we shall do no
otherwise than Hagar, who, when her bottle of water was spent, and
she saw no way of supply, sat down, gave up her son and self for lost
and so falls a-weeping over her helpless condition. This was that
sight of God, in regard of his power, goodness, faithfulness, and truth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
which are things invisible, Heb. xi. 27, which kept up the heart of
Moses, that it sunk not under the pressure of his fears, when all things
threatened his ruin.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He that would thus wait upon God <i>had need to
have an equal balance of spirit in reference to second causes</i>. Despise
or neglect them he may not, when he may have them, for
that were intolerable presumption; and so to centre our hopes and
expectations upon them, as if our welfare did certainly depend upon
them, is a high affront to God’s omnipotency, and no less than a
sinful idolizing of the creature; but the engagements of our duty must
keep carefully to the first, and the consideration of an independency
of an almighty power, as to any subordinate means or causes, must help
us against the other miscarriage. When all means visible fail us, we
must look to live upon omnipotent faithfulness and goodness, which
is not tied to anything, but that without all means, and contrary
to the powers of second causes, can do what he hath promised or
sees fit.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, There is no waiting upon God, and keeping his way,
without <i>a particular trust in God</i>. To this we are not only warranted
by frequent commands, ‘Trust in the Lord, I say, trust in the Lord,’
but highly encouraged to it under the greatest assurances of help:
Ps. xxxvii. 5, ‘Trust in him, and he shall bring it to pass.’ ‘Trust
in the Lord and do good, and verily thou shalt be fed,’ ver. 3. The
Lord shall help and deliver them, because they trust in him. And
this we are to do at ‘all times,’ and in the greatest hazards, and with
the highest security: ‘I laid me down and slept; I will not be afraid
of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round
about,’ Ps. iii. 5, 6.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But some, possibly, may say, Is it our duty to sit still in
such a case? When all the usual ways of supply fail us, must nothing
be attempted?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> (1.) I answer, first, <i>At such times greater care and diligence
is necessary in outward things</i>. That what one lawful course cannot
help, another lawful course may; and as to spiritual diligence, it
should be extraordinary. We should be more earnest and frequent in
prayer, fastings, meditations, and the exercise of graces.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, While we are in the pursuit of duty, and where the
substance of it may be preserved entire, if our straits and wants unavoidably
put us out of the way, <i>we may be satisfied to go on, though
some circumstances be necessarily waived and hindered</i>. Phinehas
might kill Zimri and Cosbi upon the command of Moses, Num. xxv.
5; and consequently in prosecution of duty, though, other circumstances
considered, it was in some respects extraordinary.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, But let the strait be what it will, <i>we must not forsake
duty</i>; for so we go out of God’s way, and do contradict that trust and
hope which we are to keep up to God-ward.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But, it may be further urged, must we, when all means fail,
positively trust in God for those very things which we might expect
in an ordinary way?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> In some cases our duty is <i>submission to his will</i>, and the particular
mercy neither positively to be expected not yet distrusted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
Thus did David behave himself when he fled from Jerusalem upon
Absalom’s rebellion; ‘Let him do what seemeth him good.’</p>

<p>But there are other cases wherein it is our duty to fix our trust
upon the particular mercy or help. I shall name four; and possibly a
great many more may be added. As,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>When mercies are expressly and particularly promised</i>:
as when the kingdom was promised to David; when a son was promised
to Abraham. Whatever had been the improbabilities of their
obtaining the thing promised, it was their duty positively to believe.
This is indeed not a general case.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>When God leads us into straits by engaging us in his
service</i>: as when Israel followed the Lord into the wilderness, in order
to an enjoyment of a further mercy, which was the possession of the
land of Canaan. When they had no water to drink, nor food to eat,
and saw no natural possibility of supply in that wilderness, they ought
positively to have expected supplies from God in an extraordinary
way; and it is reckoned up against them as their sin that they did
not believe. This was the very case of Christ under this temptation;
the Spirit led him into the wilderness upon the prosecution of a further
design. When there was no bread there to satisfy his hunger, he
refuseth to work a miracle for his supply, but leans upon an extraordinary
providence.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>When the things we want are common universal blessings,
and such as we cannot subsist without</i>. If we have nothing to
eat, and nothing to put on, yet seeing the body cannot live without
both, we must positively expect such supplies from providence, though
we see not the way whence they should arise to us. This kind of distrust,
which reflects upon the general necessary providence of God, by
which he is engaged to preserve his creatures in their stations, ‘to
clothe the grass of the field, to feed the birds of the air,’ &amp;c., Christ
doth severely challenge, ‘Shall he not much more clothe you, O ye
of little faith?’ Mat. vi. 30. He hath little or no faith, and in that
regard a very prodigy of distrust, that will not believe for necessaries.
Hence, Hab. iii. 17, the prophet resolves upon a rejoicing confidence
in God, when neither tree, nor field, nor flock would yield any hope in
an ordinary way.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>When God is eminently engaged for our help, and
his honour lies at stake in that very matter</i>; so that whether God will
help or no, or whether he is able, is become the controversy, upon
which religion in its truth or the honour of God is to be tried; then
are we engaged to a certain belief of help. The three children upon
this ground did not only assert that ‘God was able to deliver them,’
or that their death and martyrdom they could bear, which is all that
most martyrs are able to arise up to, but they asserted positively that
‘God would deliver them,’ and that the fire should not burn them.
They saw evidently that the contest, whether the Lord was God, was
managed at so high a rate, that God was more concerned to vindicate
his honour by their preservation, than to vindicate their grace and
patience by their constancy and suffering, [Dan. iii.] Another
instance we have in Mat. viii. 26, where Christ rebukes his disciples
for unbelief, in their fears of shipwreck in a great storm—not that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
every seaman ordinarily lies under that charge, that gives himself up
to the apprehensions of danger—the ground of which charge was this,
that Christ was with them, and consequently it had unavoidably contradicted
his design, and reflected upon his honour, if he had suffered
his disciples at that time to be drowned. Their not minding how far
Christ was engaged with them, and not supporting themselves against
their fears by that consideration, made Christ tax them for their little
faith.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s proceeding to infer distrust of sonship from distrust of
providences.—Instances of the probability of such a design.—The
reasons of this undertaking.—Of Satan’s endeavour to weaken
the assurance and hopes of God’s children.—His general method to
that purpose.</i></p>


<p>Lastly, we are to consider the suitableness of the means to the end.
He had, as we have seen, fitly proportioned the subordinate means to
the chief and principal. The failure of ordinary means of help was
shrewdly proper to infer a distrust of providence. Now let it be noted
how fitly he improves this distrust of providence to bring about the
end he aimed at, which was a distrust of his filial interest in God, as
if he should have thus reasoned: ‘He that in straits is forsaken, as to
all the usual supplies that may be expected in an ordinary way, hath
no reason to rely on providence; and he that hath no reason to rely
on providence for the body, hath less cause to expect spiritual blessings
and favours for the soul.’ Hence note,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 14. <i>That it is Satan’s endeavour to make men proceed from
a distrust of providence to a distrust of their spiritual sonship, or
filial interest in God.</i> First, I shall evidence that this is Satan’s
design, and next I shall give the reasons of it. The former I shall
make good by these several considerations:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>We see it is a usual inference that others make of men
whose heart fails them, under an absence or disappearance of all means
of help in their distresses</i>. If providence doth not appear for them,
they conclude God hath forsaken them. Bildad thus concludes against
Job, chap. iv. 6, ‘Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
uprightness of thy ways?’ Which must not only be understood as
an ironical scoff at the weakness of his confidence and hope, as not
being able to support him against fainting in his trouble, but as a
direct accusation of the falseness and hypocrisy of his supposed integrity,
and all the hopes and confidence which was built upon it; and
ver. 7 doth evidence, where he plainly declares himself to mean that
Job could not be innocent or righteous, it being, in his apprehension,
a thing never heard of, that so great calamities should overtake an
upright man, ‘Who ever perished, being innocent?’ The ground of
which assertion was from ver. 5, ‘It is now come upon thee, and thou
faintest.’ That is, distresses are upon thee, and thou hast no visible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
means of help, but despairest ever to see a providence that will bring
thee out; therefore surely thou hast had no real interest in God, as his
child. Eliphaz also seconds his friend in this uncharitable censure,
‘If thou wert pure and upright, he would awake for thee,’ Job viii. 6;
that is, because he doth thus overlook thee, therefore thou art not pure
and upright.</p>

<p>If men do thus assault the comforts of God’s children, we have
reason enough to think that Satan will; for besides that we may conclude
they are set on work by the devil, and what he speaks by them,
he will also by other ways promote, as being a design that is upon his
heart; we may be confident, that this being a surmise so natural to
the heart of man, he will not let slip so fair an advantage, for the
forming of it in our own hearts against ourselves.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>The best of God’s children, in such cases, escape it
very hardly, if at all</i>; which declares not only the depth and power of
that policy, but also how usual it is with Satan to urge the servants of
God with it. Job, chap. xix. 25, recovered himself to a firm persuasion
of sonship, ‘I know that my Redeemer liveth,’ &amp;c.; but by
the way his foot had well-nigh slipped, when, ver. 10, 11, he cries
out, ‘He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone; he hath
also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as
one of his enemies.’ His earnest resolve not to give up his trust in
God, and the confidence of his integrity, is sufficient to discover Satan’s
eager endeavours to have him bereaved of it.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>Satan’s success in this temptation over the saints of
God, who sometime have actually failed</i>, shews how much it is his
work to cast down their hopes of interest in God, by overthrowing
their trust in his providences. If he attempts this, and that successfully,
on such whose frequent experiences might discourage the tempter,
and in probability frustrate his undertaking; we have little cause to
think that he will be more sparing and gentle in this assault upon
those that are more weak, and less acquainted with those clouds and
darknesses that overshadow the ways of providence. David, for all
the promises that he had received, and notwithstanding the manifold
trials that he had of seasonable and unexpected deliverances, yet when
he was distressed, he once and again falls into a fear of his soul, and
a questioning of God’s favour. He complains as one utterly forsaken,
‘Why hast thou forsaken me?’ Ps. xxii. 1. In Ps. lxix., he expresseth
himself, ver. 1, ‘sinking in the deep mire,’ as a man that had no
firm ground to stand upon, and that his troubles had brought him to
fear the state of his soul, not only as deprived of God’s favour—and
therefore, ver. 17, begs that his face may be no longer hid—but also as
suspecting the loss of it; ver. 18, ‘draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem
it.’ Ps. lxxvii., upon the occasion of outward troubles, Asaph falls
into such a fit of fear about his spiritual condition, that no consideration
of former mercies could relieve him, ‘He remembered God,’ ver.
3, ‘but was troubled;’ he ‘considered the days of old,’ called to
remembrance his ‘songs in the night;’ but none of these were effectual
to keep him from that sad outcry of distrust, ver. 7, ‘Will the Lord
cast off for ever? is his mercy clean gone for ever? hath God forgotten
to be gracious?’ &amp;c. Which upon the review, in the composing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
the psalm, he acknowledged an unbelieving miscarriage; I said, ‘This
is mine infirmity.’</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, It is also a common and ordinary thing with most,
<i>to entertain misapprehensions of their spiritual condition, when they
meet with disappointments of providence</i>. Hence the apostle, Heb.
xii. 5, 6, when he would quiet the hearts of men under the Lord’s
chastening, doth of purpose make use of this encouragement, that God
speaks to them in the rod as to children, and such as are under his
care and love, ‘My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord;’
‘whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth,’ &amp;c. Which certainly tells us
thus much, that it is ordinary for men to doubt their sonship because
of their afflictions. We may conjecture what the malady is, when we
know what is prepared as a medicine. This would not have been a
common remedy, ‘that we may be children, though we be scourged,’
if the disbelief of this had not been the usual interpretation of afflictions,
and a common distemper.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, We may further take notice, <i>that those disquiets of
mind, that were only occasioned by outward things, and seem to have
no affinity, either in the nature of the occasion, or present inclination
of the party, with a spiritual trouble; yet if they continue long, do
wholly change their nature</i>. They that at first only troubled themselves
for losses or crosses, forget these troubles and take up fears for
their souls.</p>

<p>Sometime this ariseth from a natural softness and timorousness of
spirit. Such are apt to misgive upon any occasion, and to say, Surely
if I were his child, he would not thus forsake me; his fatherly compassions
would some way or other work towards me.</p>

<p>Sometime this ariseth from melancholy, contracted or heightened
by outward troubles. These, when they continue long, and pierce
deep, put men into ‘a spirit of heaviness,’ which makes them refuse
to be comforted. Here the devil takes his advantage. Unlawful
sorrows are as delightfully improved by him as unlawful pleasures;
they are <i>Diaboli balneum</i>, his bath in which he sports himself, as the
leviathan in the waters. When for temporal losses or troubles men
fall into melancholy, if they be not relieved soon, then their grief
changeth its object, and presently they disquiet themselves, as being
out of God’s favour, as being estranged from God, as being of the
number of the damned; such against whom the door of mercy is shut,
and so cry out of themselves as hopeless and miserable. The observations
of physicians afford store of instances of this kind. Felix Platerus
gives one, of a woman at Basle who first grieved for the death of her
son, and when by this means she grew melancholy, that changed into
a higher trouble; she mourns that her sins would not be pardoned,
that God would not have mercy for her soul. Another, for some loss
of wheat, first vexeth himself for that, and then at last despairs of the
happiness of his soul; with a great many more of that kind.<a id="FNanchor_393_393" href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></p>

<p>Sometimes a desperate humour doth, from the same occasion, distract
men into a fury; of which Mercerus gives one instance from his
own knowledge, of a person who, upon the distresses which he met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
with, fell into a rage against God, uttering speeches full of horror and
blasphemy, not fit to be related.<a id="FNanchor_394_394" href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a></p>

<p>If there be such an affinity betwixt distrust of providence and distrust
of sonship, that the one slides into the other naturally; if this
be common to all men under troubles, to suspect their souls; if the
best do here actually miscarry; if those that do not, yet hardly escape;
and if bystanders commonly give this judgment of men in straits, that
there is no help for them in their God; we cannot but collect from
all this, that it is an advantage which Satan will not neglect, and that
he doth very much employ himself to bring it about.</p>

<p>The reasons of it are these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>Distrust of providence hath in it the very formal nature
of distrust of sonship</i>. If the object of distrust were but changed, it
would without any further addition work that way. He that trusts
providence acknowledgeth that God knoweth his wants, that he is of
a merciful inclination to give what he sees he hath need of; that he
hath manifested this by promise, that he is so faithful that this promise
cannot be neglected, and that he hath power to do what he hath promised.<a id="FNanchor_395_395" href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a>
He that distrusts providence disbelieves all these, consequentially
at least; and he that will not believe that God takes any
care of the body, or that he is of a merciful disposition toward him,
or thinks either he hath made no such promise, or will not keep it, if
any such were made; cannot believe, if that doubt were but once
started, that God is his Father, or that he hath interest in the privilege
of a son, seeing it is impossible to believe a sonship, while his care,
mercy, promises, and power are distrusted. In this then Satan’s work
is very easy. It is but his moving the question about the Lord’s
mercy to the soul, and presently, as when new matter is ministered to
a raging flame, it takes hold upon it, and with equal, nay greater,
force it carries the soul to distrust spiritual mercies, as before it disbelieved
temporal kindnesses.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>The same reasons, which any man doth gather from
the seeming neglect or opposition of providence, upon which he grounds
his distrust of the Lord’s kindness in reference to outward things, will
also serve as arguments for a distrust of spiritual favours</i>. The distresses
of men seem to argue—[1.] That there is sin and provocation
on their part; [2.] And that there is a manifestation of anger on God’s
part; [3.] And from these apprehensions ariseth bitterness, anxiety,
fear, and dejection of spirit, which intercepts all the help and consolation
which might arise from other considerations of the Lord’s promise
or mercy, for the quieting of the heart and fortifying it against
such apprehensions. These same grounds, with the prevailing fears
and perplexities arising from them, are enough to make us suspect
that we are not yet under any such peculiar favours as may bespeak
us his children by adoption; so that from the same premises Satan
will conclude, that as he hath no care for our bodies, so no love to
our souls; that we neither love God nor are beloved of him. Betwixt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
the one conclusion and the other there is but a step, and with a
small labour he can cut the channel, and let in that very distrust to
run with all its force against our spiritual interest in God.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>To trust God for the soul is a higher act than to trust
him for the body</i>. The soul being of greater excellency than the body,
and the mercy necessary for the happiness of it being more precious
and less visible, it must require a higher confidence in God to assure
of this than satisfy us in the other. It is more easy to believe a lesser
kindness from a friend than a singular or extraordinary favour. He,
then, that cannot trust God for temporal mercies, shall be more unable
to believe eternal blessings. ‘If we run with footmen, and they
have wearied us, shall we be able to contend with horsemen? If the
shallow brooks be too strong for us, what shall we do in the swellings
of Jordan?’ [Jer. xii. 5.]</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>When faith is weakened as to one object, it is so
tainted and discouraged that it is generally weakened as to all other</i>.
If the hand be so weakened that it cannot hold a ring, it will be less
able to grasp a crown. When we are baffled in our trust for temporal
mercies, if Satan then put us to it not to believe for spiritual blessings,
how can we expect but to be much more at a loss in them? So that
he is sure of the victory before he fights, and he that is so sedulous to
take advantage against us will not lose so considerable a conquest for
want of pursuit. There is indeed one thing that may seem fit to be
objected against this, which is, that men may retain their faith in one
thing when yet they distrust in another, as the Israelites distrusted the
power and goodness of God for bread and flesh in the wilderness, when
yet they believed that as he had given water out of the rock, so he
could do it again if there were need: Ps. lxxviii. 20, ‘He smote the
rock, and the waters gushed out; but can he give bread?’ as if they
had said, We believe he can give water, but it is impossible he should
provide bread. But they that would thus object may consider that
the reason of men’s confidence in one thing, while distrust is in other
things prevailing, is not from any real strength of their faith, but a
present want of a temptation. If such a confidence were put to it, it
would quickly be seen that it were truly nothing. As confident as
the Israelites were that they could believe for a supply of water, we
find that neither that experience, nor the other of supplying them with
manna and quails, were sufficient to keep up their trust in God, but
that at the next strait all was to seek: ver. 32, ‘For all this they
sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.’</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, Besides all the forementioned advantages that Satan
hath in raising this temptation, of distrusting sonship out of a distrust
of providence, we may suppose him the more earnest in this matter,
<i>because it is so provoking to God to distrust his providence, that he
often, as a just chastisement of that evil, punisheth it by giving them
up to distrust him for their souls</i>. The height of the provocation may
be measured by this, that it is not only a denial of God that is above,
but usually a vesting some mean and contemptible thing with those
attributes which only suit a God infinite and eternal. As Israel did
not only forsake the Almighty by their distrust, but place their hopes
upon Ashur, upon their own horses and warlike preparations, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
last upon the works of their hands, which they called their gods,
Hosea xiv. 2, 3. How offensive this is to the Lord, we may observe
by that notable check which the prophet gave Ahaz, Isa. vii. 8, 13,
notwithstanding his compliment of refusing a sign, which God offered
him for the strengthening of his hope, upon a pretence that he would
trust without it,—though indeed he absolutely distrusted him, as appears
by 2 Chron. xxviii. 20,—that it was a weaning<a id="FNanchor_396_396" href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> and tiring out
the patience of a long-suffering God: ‘Is it a small thing for you to
weary men, but will you weary my God also?’ God is so active and
jealous of all encroachments of this kind, that they may expect he will
give up such offenders to be punished by the terrors of a higher distrust.
He that is not owned as a God in his providences, will not be
owned as a Father for spiritual mercies; they that will not own him
for the body, shall not be able to lay hold upon him or his strength to
be at peace with him for their souls; and by this piece of just discipline
he often cures the distrust of providence in his children, who
when they see themselves plunged into terrors and fears about their
everlasting welfare, do not only call God just, and accept of the
punishment of their iniquity in distrusting him for smaller matters,
but now wish with all their hearts that they might have no greater
thing to trouble them than what relates to the body or this life.</p>

<p>To sum up all these reasons in one word: Satan hath from the forementioned
considerations <i>a certain expectation of prevalency</i>. For
not only in this case doth God, as it were, fight for him, by giving
them up to distrust their filial interest that have provoked him by a
distrust of providence, and our faith is also so weakened by the former
overthrow that it is not able to maintain its ground in a higher
matter; but also this distrust carries that in the nature and grounds
of it that will of itself work up to a disbelief of spiritual mercies. He
knows, then, that this piece of the victory is an easy consequence of
the former; and we may say of it as the prophet Nahum, chap. iii.
12, of the strongholds of Nineveh, It is like ‘a fig-tree with the first
ripe figs, if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the
eater.’ This temptation of distrusting our sonship falls into Satan’s
mouth with a little labour, when once he hath prevailed so far as to
make us distrust the providence of God in outward matters.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> <i>This must warn and caution us against any unbeseeming
unbelieving entertainment of jealousy against the Lord’s providence.</i>
We are but too apt in our straits to take a greater liberty to question
his mercy and power, not foreseeing how closely this borders upon a
greater evil. We may say of it, as the apostle speaks of ‘babbling in
controversies,’ that they ‘lead to more ungodliness,’ and that such
words ‘eat as a canker,’ [2 Tim. ii. 17;] so doth this distrust usually
carry us further, and when we fall out with God for small matters, he
will be angry in earnest, and withdraw from us our consolations in
greater. In the depth of your distresses, when your fears are round
about you, and God seems to compass you about with his net,—when
lover and friend forsakes, and when there is no appearance of help,
endeavour, for the keeping hold of your interest in God, to behave
yourselves according to the following directions:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span></p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>Look upon the providences of God to be as a great deep,
the bottom of whose ways and designs you cannot reach</i>. Think of
them as of a mystery, which indeed you must study, but not throw
away, because you cannot at first understand it. Providences are not
to be dealt with as Alexander did by Gordius his knot, who when he
could not loose it he cut it. If you see not the end of the Lord, or
cannot meet with a door of hope in it, yet ‘lay your hand upon your
mouth,’ speak not, think not evil of things you know not, but wait till
the time of their ‘bringing forth.’</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>You must keep up in your hearts high and honourable
thoughts of God</i>, yea, of his mercy and goodness, and where you cannot
see your way, or God’s way, before you, yet, as it were by a kind
of implicit faith, must you believe that he is holy and good in all his
ways.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Though you may read your sins or God’s displeasure
in them, and accordingly endeavour to humble yourselves and call
yourselves vile, yet must it be always remembered that <i>eternal love
or eternal hatred is not to be measured by them</i>.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>Restrain complainings</i>. It is indeed an ease to complain;
‘I will speak,’ saith Job, ‘that I may be refreshed,’ chap. xxxii.
20; notwithstanding a vent being given, it is difficult to keep within
bounds. Our complainings entice us to distrust, as may appear in
Job, who took a boldness this way more than was fit, as chap. x. 3, ‘Is
it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, and that thou shouldest
despise the work of thine hands?’</p>

<p>All this hath been said in the opening of the temptation itself. Now
must I consider the motive that Satan used to bring on the temptation
by, ‘If thou be the Son of God,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The question that is here moved by some is, whether Satan really
knew or truly doubted Christ to be the Son of God. Several learned men
think that he was in doubt,<a id="FNanchor_397_397" href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> and the reasons are variously conjectured.
Cyprian conceives that the unity of the two natures in one person did
blind him; he knew it to be impossible that the divine nature should
hunger, and might think it strange that the human nature should fast
so long.<a id="FNanchor_398_398" href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> Cornelius a-Lapide thinks that Satan knew that there
should be two natures united in one person, and that this occasioned
Satan’s fall, while he proudly stomached the exaltation of the human
nature; but he imagines Satan’s doubt arose from a doubtful sense of
that phrase, ‘This is my beloved Son,’ as not knowing whether Christ
were the natural or an adopted son of God.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding these apprehensions, others conceive that Satan
knew very well who Christ was, and that being privy to so many
things relating to him, as the promises which went before and directly
pointed out the time, the angel’s salutation of Mary at his conception,
the star that conducted the wise men to him, the testimony from
heaven concerning him, with a great many things more, he could not
possibly be ignorant that he was the Messias and the Son of God by
nature. Neither doth that expression, ‘If thou be the Son of God,’
imply any doubting, seeing that that is usually expressive of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
greatest certainty and assurance, as in the speech of Lamech, ‘If Cain
shall be avenged sevenfold,’ that is, as certainly he shall be avenged;
so Satan might use it to this sense, ‘If, or seeing thou art the Son of
God.’ Now, whereas it may seem strange that he should set upon
Christ, if he knew who he was, I have answered that before, and shall
here only add that though Satan did believe Christ to be the Son of
God, yet so strongly did the power of malice work in him, that he
would have had him to have doubted that he was not so. From all
this we have this observation,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 15. <i>That the great design of Satan is to weaken the assurance
and hopes of the children of God in their adoption.</i></p>

<p>This is the masterpiece of his design, the very centre in which
most of his devices meet. We may say of him as Esau said of Jacob,
‘Is he not rightly called Jacob, a supplanter?’ [Genesis xxvii. 36;]
he first stole away our birthright at the creation, and now he seeks to
take away our blessing in Christ the Redeemer.</p>

<p>The reasons of this undertaking I shall not here insist on. It is
sufficiently obvious that the greatest perplexity and sorrow ariseth to
the children of God from hence, and that a troop of other spiritual
evils, as impatience, fury, blasphemy, and many more, doth follow it
at the heels, besides all that inability for service, and at last plain
neglect of all duty. All I shall further do at this time shall be to
shew in a few particulars, from Satan’s carriage to Christ in this
temptation, how and after what manner he doth manage that design,
in which note:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>That it is his design to sever us from the promise, and
to weaken our faith in that</i>. When Eve was tempted, this was that
he aimed at, that she should question the good earnest of the prohibition,
‘Hath God said so?’ Was he real in that command, that you
should not eat at all? &amp;c. The like he doth to Christ, ‘Is it true?
or can it be so as that voice declared, that thou art the Son of God?’</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>Though this be his design, yet his way to come to it
is not at first to deny it, but to question and inquire</i>; yet after such a
manner as may imply and withal suggest a doubting or suspicion that
it is not so. He doth not come to Christ thus, ‘Thou art not the
Son of God; or that voice that gave thee that testimony was but a lie
or a delusion;’ but he rather proceeds by questioning, which might
seem to grant that he was so, yet withal might possibly beget a doubt
in his mind.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>Next he more plainly suggests something that may
seem to argue the contrary</i>; for thus he aggravates Christ’s present
condition of want, ‘Can it be that God would leave thee to these
oppressing straits, if thou wert his Son?’ At this rate he deals with
us, improving the failure of outward means of help, the permission of
temptation, the want of comfort, the continuance of affliction, notwithstanding
prayers, &amp;c., as probabilities that we belong not to God.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>After this he urgeth Christ to a sinful miscarriage,
to distrust providence, and to rely no longer on the care of his Father</i>.
If Christ had been prevailed with in this, he would have made use of
it as an argument to prove that he was not the Son of God indeed.
It is usual in his disputings with us about adoption, to put us upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
something which may be as an argument out of our own mouths
against us. Christ might have answered him in this as the man
answered Joab, ‘If I should do so, then thou thyself wouldst set thyself
against me.’</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, When at last he hath gradually ascended to that confidence
as to deny our adoption, <i>then, at a very great disadvantage, he
puts us upon the proof, in which he puts by the ordinary evidences, and
insists on extraordinary proofs as necessary</i>. The servants of the
Lord that are under this exercise, do find that in this case the ordinary
evidences of repentance, mortification, love to the brethren, &amp;c.,
do nothing for them. Satan puts their spirit upon clamouring for
higher evidences. Nothing will serve except they may view the
records of eternity, and read their names enrolled in the everlasting
decrees, or except God will speak from heaven in an extraordinary
way, to testify of them, as Thomas resolved that no less should satisfy
his doubt than the feeling and seeing of the print of the nails. To
this purpose some stand upon no less than a miracle for proof of sonship.
Of which we have two instances of later years, the one Mrs
Honywood, the other Mrs Sarah Wight,<a id="FNanchor_399_399" href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> who in their distresses for
their souls were tempted by Satan to make a hasty experiment, the
one by throwing a Venice glass, the other by throwing a cup against
the wall, with this or the like expression, ‘If I must be saved, then
let not this glass break’—a desperate temptation! Their manner of
desiring satisfaction is so provoking, that it cannot be expected God
will give an answer by it, but rather the contrary; and if he should
not condescend, as he is not bound—though he strangely preserved the
cup and glass fore-mentioned from breaking—what a dangerous conclusion
would Satan draw from it! Of this nature and design was
that proposal of Satan’s to Christ, ‘Command that these stones be
made bread,’ that is, do it as a proof of thy sonship.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> By this we must learn this skill, <i>not too easily to give up
our hopes, or to be prodigal of our interest in Christ, so as to part with
it slenderly</i>. If Satan would chiefly rob us of this, we may learn
thence to put a price upon these jewels, and to account that precious,
and of singular concernment, which he useth so much cunning to bereave
us of. Many of the Lord’s servants may justly blame themselves for
their lavish unthriftiness in this matter, who, as if it were a necessary
piece of humility or modesty, will readily conclude against themselves
that they are not God’s children, that they are not yet converted, &amp;c.
Thus, at unawares, they give up to Satan without a stroke all that he
seeks for.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But you will say, Must all men be confident of adoption?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> No, I mean not so; yet all men must be wary how they cast
away their hopes. Particularly,</p>

<p>[1.] First, Though it be a dangerous arrogancy for a sinful, wicked
creature to bear himself up in a belief that he is converted and actually
instated into the adoption of sons; yet it is as dangerous, on the other
hand, for that man to cast off all hope, and to say he is reprobated,
and such a one as cannot expect pardon and grace.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Those that are converted, though they may and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
ought to humble themselves deeply for their sinful miscarriage, and
sincerely acknowledge that they deserve not to be called his children,
yet must they be careful not to renounce their filial interest. They
may say they are prodigal, yet keep to this, that they are sons; though
they are wandering sheep, yet must they stick here, that they are sheep
still, and that God is still a Father, though a provoked Father, otherwise
their folly will give more than all his fury could get, at least
so quickly and easily.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIII_3">CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p><i>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on the
pinnacle of the temple.</i>—Mat. iv. 5.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The preparation to the second temptation.—Of his nimbleness to catch
advantages from our answers to temptation.—That Satan carried
Christ in the air.—Of his power to molest the bodies of God’s children.—How
little the supposed holiness of places privilegeth us
from Satan.—Of Satan’s policy in seeming to countenance imaginary
defences.—Of his pretended flight in such cases, with the reasons
of that policy.—Of his improving a temptation to serve several
ends.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>I omit Christ’s answer to the first temptation at present, purposing
to handle his answers to all the temptations together. And now the
second temptation is before us, in which, first, I shall observe a few
things in Satan’s preparation to the temptation, which takes in [1.]
The time; [2.] The manner of his carrying him; [3.] The place where
he acted it.</p>

<p>(1.) First, For the time. That is noted in the word ‘then,’ which
[1.] Points at the immediate succession of this to the former assault.
The evangelist Luke puts this temptation last, but he only had respect
to the substance of the temptation in his narration; not regarding
the order of them, which Matthew hath punctually observed, as appears
by his close connecting of them, with the particles ‘then’ and ‘again,’
ver. 5, 8. Besides, whosoever shall consider that in the first, Satan
tempted Christ to distrust, which he repelled by telling him that
it was his duty, in the failure of outward means, to rely upon divine
providence, seeing man lives not by bread alone, &amp;c., he will see so
much of connexion in the matter of the temptations that he will easily
persuade himself that the second place belongs to this, for this is but,
as it were, a fit and pertinent reply to Christ’s refusal; as if Satan had
said, ‘Since thou wilt rely upon the help and providence of God in an
extraordinary way of working, give an experiment of that by casting
thyself down, which thou mayest with greater confidence do, because
he hath promised an extraordinary help, and hath given his angels
charge concerning thee,’ &amp;c. Hence observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 1. <i>That Satan is not discouraged easily, nor doth he always
desist upon the first repulse, but frequently renews the assault when he
is strongly and resolutely resisted.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p>This word, ‘then,’ doth also [2.] Tell us of Satan’s nimbleness
in catching a present advantage for a new temptation from Christ’s
answer. He declared his trust in providence; this he presently lays
hold on as a fit opportunity to tempt him to presumption. Here
note,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 2. <i>That when Satan is upon any design, if an occasional advantage
occur from our way of refusal, he will not let it slip, but improves
it to what it may lead to, though it be contrary to that which he was
first labouring for.</i></p>

<p>This was the policy which Benhadad’s servants used in their address
to Ahab, 1 Kings xx. 33; the men did diligently observe whether
anything would come from him, and did hastily catch it. If anything
come from us we are under his temptation, he is diligent to observe
it, and prosecutes it accordingly; which may serve to satisfy the wonder
that some have concerning the contrariety in the temptations to which
they are urged. They admire how it comes to pass that their
temptations should so suddenly alter, that when Satan seems to be
so intent upon one design, he should so quickly change, and urge
them presently to a different or contrary thing; but they may know
that the devil watcheth the wind, and spreads his sail according to the
advantage which ariseth from our answer or repulse. So that if we
would but plough with our own heifer, and observe our frame of
spirit, we should easily find out this riddle. For as it is in disputings
and arguings of men, replies beget new matter for answer, and so do
they multiply one another; thus are temptations altered and multiplied,
and out of the ashes of one assault repelled, another doth quickly
spring up.</p>

<p>The second circumstance of preparation is, <i>Satan’s taking him up
and setting him on the temple</i>. That this was not a visionary or an
imaginary thing, hath been proved before. Yet granting it to have
been real, as in truth it seems to have been, it is disputed what
was the <i>modus</i>, the way and manner of it. Some think this was no
more than Christ’s voluntary following of Satan, who guided and
conducted the way;<a id="FNanchor_400_400" href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> partly because the words παραλαμβάνειν and
ἄγειν are in Scripture accommodated to a man’s taking of any as a
companion under his guide and conduct of the way, and to a disposal
of them in any kind of station. Thus, where it is said, ‘Joseph took
Mary and the young child to go to Egypt,’ Mat. ii. 13, the same word
is used; and when Christ tells his disciples that they shall bring the
ass and the colt which they should find tied, the same word which
expresseth Christ being set on the temple is there used, Mat. xxii. 2.
Partly also, they think it below the dignity of Christ to be thus violently
hurried.</p>

<p>Others think that Satan was permitted to take up the body of
Christ, and by his power to have conveyed him in the air; and indeed
the whole series of the narration, with all the circumstances thereof,
are evident for it. The distances of places, the quickness and speediness
of the removals, the more proper applications of the words, ‘taking’
and ‘setting,’ to Satan as the actor, and the declaration of his
power therein, as able to do great things; these make the matter so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
clear, that it seems to be an unnatural forcing of the text to give it
any other interpretation. Besides, the former opinion of Satan’s taking
of Christ, as a manuductor or guide, seems every way unreasonable;
for if Christ only followed Satan, then it must have been either by a
land journey on foot or in the air. This latter it could not be; for if
Christ had supported himself in the air by his own power, he had
anticipated the temptation, and it would have been folly and madness
for Satan to have urged him to fly in the air, after such an evidence
of his power; and who can imagine that Christ followed Satan on foot
from the wilderness to the temple, or that his access to the roof of the
temple was so easy, in such a way when the temple was always so
strictly guarded? Note, hence,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 3. <i>That Satan is sometime permitted to exercise his power
upon the bodies of those that are dear to God.</i> That he hath power
to carry the bodies of men in the air, is sufficiently confirmed by what
he doth frequently to witches, who are usually carried, if we can give
any credit to the stories that are writ of them, in the air, to places
far remote from their dwellings, <i>equitatio cum Diana aut Herodiade</i>.
And that this power is permitted him upon others, than such as are in
compact with him, is as evident from what is testified of those whose
forward curiosity hath led to imitate witches in their anointings, who
have thereupon been conveyed after them to their assemblies, and
when the company hath been suddenly dismissed, they have been
found many miles distant from their dwellings; such instances we have
in Bodin, and among other things that of Domina Rossa mentioned by
him, whom Satan would sometime bind to a tree, sometime to a table,
or to a bed’s-foot, or to a manger, sometime one hand bound to another;
the devil thus molested her from eight years old, a long time.<a id="FNanchor_401_401" href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
This power of conveying persons in the air is not usual, yet there are
some in this place—Newcastle—that have known one frequently
molested by Satan at this rate. However, if we take notice of his
power to abuse the bodies of holy persons more generally, we shall
find it frequent. Mary Magdelene was possessed; Christ mentions a
daughter of Abraham bowed down by him many years; Job was filled
with botches and sores; and there are many diseases wherein Satan
hath a greater hand than is commonly imagined. Physicians frequently
conclude so much, while they observe some distempers to elude
such remedies as are usually successful upon other persons under the
same diseases.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> From this we may infer, [1.] The great power of Satan;
who can tell the extent of it? doubtless, if he were permitted, we
should see sad instances hereof daily. [2.] This discovers the wonderful
care and providence of God over us in our preservation from
his fury. [3.] We may further note that the abuse of the bodies of
men by Satan, will be no evidence that therefore God doth disregard
them, or that they are not precious to him. Christ did undergo
this abuse, to give such as shall be so molested, some comfort in his
example.</p>

<p>The third circumstance, which is that <i>of place</i>, is set down first in
general, ‘the holy city,’ that is Jerusalem, for so Luke speaks expressly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
Luke iv. 9. Jerusalem was so called, because of God’s worship there
established, and his peculiar presence there; but that it should be
called so at this time may seem strange, seeing it might now be
lamented as of old, ‘How is the faithful city become an harlot!
Righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers,’ [Isa. i. 21.] In answer
to this, we must know that God having not yet given her a bill of
divorce, he is pleased to continue her title and privilege. This might
be profitably improved; but I will not suffer myself to be diverted from
the matter of temptation, which is the only thing I propound to prosecute
from hence. I shall here only observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 4. <i>That the holiness or sanctity of a place will be no privilege
against temptations.</i> He is not so fearful, as many imagine, as that
he dares not approach a churchyard or a church; neither place nor
duty can keep him off. I do not believe the popish fiction of their
St Bennet’s vision, wherein they tell of his seeing but one devil in a
market, and ten in a monastery; yet I question not the truth of this,
that the devil is as busy at a sermon or prayer as at any other
employment.</p>

<p>But to search a little further into this matter, it seems undeniable
that Satan had a design in reference to the place, of which afterward;
and I see no reason to exclude our suspicion of a design from the name
and title which the evangelist here gives to Jerusalem. It is an expression
which, to my remembrance, we meet not with oft in the New
Testament. At the suffering of Christ, when the bodies of the saints
arose out of their graves, it is said ‘they went into the holy city,’ Mat.
xxvii. 53; but it is evident that it is there so styled upon special
design, as if the evangelist would by that point at the staining of their
glory, and that in a little time their boast of the temple and holy city
should cease, and that all should be polluted with the carcases of the
slain. And by the same reason may we suppose that Satan, intending
for Christ a temptation of presumption, and backing it with the promise
of a guard of angels, had in his eye the usual confidence that the
Jews had of that city, as a place where the presence of angels might be
more expected than elsewhere. So that it seems Satan intended to
impose upon Christ a confidence in order to presumption. From the
privilege of the place, here observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 5. <i>That Satan is willing to gratify us with nominal and
imaginary privileges and defences against himself.</i> He will willingly
allow us such defences as are altogether insignificant and delusive, and
his policy here is centred upon these two things:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>He doth industriously prompt us to self-devised inventions</i>,
such as were never appointed or blessed of God to any such use;
but only found out by the bold superstitions of men. Of this we have
an instance in Balak, who carried Baalam from place to place in his
prosecution of his design of cursing Israel; neither can we imagine
that a commodious prospect of Israel was all he aimed at, seeing he
discovers his mind in this variation of places, ‘Peradventure it will
please God that thou mayest curse them from thence,’ Num. xxiii. 27;
clearly implying that he had a confidence that the place might contribute
something to his design, and that there was some inherent
virtue in those consecrated places; and therefore did he begin with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
high-places of Baal, and then to the held of Zophim, and then to the
top of Peor, Num. xxii. 27, xxiii. 14, 28. Among the papists we find
too much of this. What power they attribute to holy water, blessed
salt, sign of the cross, hallowed earth, consecrated places, relics, baptized
bells, exorcisms, and abundance of such stuff, may be seen in
many of their writings, too tedious to be related.<a id="FNanchor_402_402" href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, He is also willing <i>that men use those real defences and
helps which God hath commanded, so that they use them in a formal
manner</i>, which indeed deprives them of all the life and efficacy that might
be expected from an instituted means. Thus he readily permits ignorant
persons, without any disturbance or molestation, to use the repetition
of the Lord’s prayer, ten commandments, and creed, or any other
prayer, while they persuade themselves that the very saying of the words
is a sufficient defence against the devil all that day.</p>

<p>The reasons of Satan’s policy in such gratifications are these:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>While we are kept doing with these, we are diverted from
that which might be really helpful</i>. He puts a broken reed into our
hand, that we might be deprived of a staff. Experience confirms this.
Those that, with greatest devotion, use these empty inventions, are
usually careless in the use of God’s own appointments.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Besides that he thus betrays them by these lying helps,
he doth by this means cast them on a further iniquity of idolising these
foolish calves of their own invention</i>. In this case men have a presumptuous
expectation from such usages of that which God never
promised to do by them, neither ever entered into his heart so to do,
seeing he answers them all with this, ‘Who hath required these things
at your hands?’ [Isa. i. 12.] And accordingly their consciences are more
concerned for the omission of one of these fooleries, than for the neglect of
the greater things of the law. Such are more troubled for the neglect
of the sign of the cross or holy water, than for their constant carelessness
and want of faith, by which their hearts should be guarded against
their enemy.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>In the meantime he makes work for his own triumph
over them that dote upon these sottish inventions</i>. If we can suppose
Satan to have pleasure or mirth at anything, we may be sure he will
laugh at such preparations for a spiritual welfare,<a id="FNanchor_403_403" href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> it being as truly
ridiculous for any man to go out with these weapons against Satan, as
for a combatant to assail a giant with a paper helmet, a wicker shield,
and a wooden dagger. And indeed when Satan counterfeits a flight or
fear of such matters, as for his advantage he sometimes doth, it is but
in design to beget or confirm in men a confidence of a virtue or strength
in these usages against his power, that so they may fix upon them to
the neglect of God’s own institutions, which he most dreads. Thus we
read that he cunningly ceased his oracle at Daphne upon a pretence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
the silencing power of the bones of the martyr Babilas, which were
buried near the place, on purpose to lead unwary Christians to the
adoration of saints and their relics.<a id="FNanchor_404_404" href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> Many such instances we have in
Sprenger, of the devil’s feigned flight at the sign of the cross, the
sprinkling of holy water, the angelical salutation, St Bernard’s staff,
or certain words and verses hung about the neck.<a id="FNanchor_405_405" href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> And a great deal
of such stuff we may meet with in most of their writers, all which are
but cunning contrivances of Satan, to advance a belief of the virtue of
these things; and so to stop men there, to the neglect of those spiritual
weapons which the Scripture recommends.</p>

<p>These we have observed from the place in general, ‘the holy city.’
Let us go on to the place in particular where Satan acted all this, ‘the
pinnacle of the temple.’ Various are the conjectures of men about
this, whether it were some fane, or the top of some spire, or the place
whence the apostle James was thrown down, or the top of the king’s
porch, which was erected to a great height over a deep valley, or some
battlement, &amp;c. But we are not concerned in such inquiries; only
here shall I take notice of Scultetus, who, supposing the place to be
the top of a fane or spire, and reading in Josephus that the points of
such broaches were so sharp that a bird could not rest upon them
without piercing its foot, was therefore willing to conclude that these
temptations were not really and historically acted, but in vision only.<a id="FNanchor_406_406" href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a>
All this ariseth from a wrong interpretation of πτερύγιον, which our
English renders <i>pinnacle</i>, whereas it properly signifies any battlement
or angular prominency, jutting out over the rest like a wing, which
would afford a sufficient footing and support.<a id="FNanchor_407_407" href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p>

<p>It is more profitable to inquire after Satan’s reason for the choice
of such a place. No question but it was upon design, for else he might
with equal convenience have tempted Christ to cast himself down from
some tree or precipice in the wilderness; but then what that design
was, is not so easy to determine. It seems plain that he might suppose
that Christ might be the rather animated to the undertaking of flying
in the air by the hopes of glory which might be expected from such a
performance before so many spectators. But some think that he had
a design also upon the men of Jerusalem, and intended some delusion
to the Jews,<a id="FNanchor_408_408" href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> which I am not unwilling to close with, partly because
the experiences that we have of his devices assure us that in one temptation
his ends are oft manifold; and I cannot but think that Satan
would make all things sure, and provide, in his projecting mind, against
all events. For if Christ should have yielded and evidenced so great
a power in the sight of all the people, it might have been a conviction
general that he was the Messiah, about that time universally expected;
and partly I am ready to think so, because, in case Christ had done so,
it lay so fair to confirm the Jews in a misapprehension of the personal
coming of Elias, of whom they understood the prophecy of Mal.
iii. 1, ‘Behold, I will send my messenger; and he shall prepare the
way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to
his temple, even the messenger of the covenant.’<a id="FNanchor_409_409" href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> If the Jews<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
expected Elias to come from heaven to the temple, how strongly would
they have been confirmed in this opinion if they had seen a man fly
from the temple in the air; and by this means John the Baptist, who
was the Elias that was to come, should have been neglected, and Christ
himself, though honoured as Elias, not owned for the Messiah.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 6. Observe then, <i>That Satan’s designs are large, and that he
projects the ensnaring or deluding of others by such temptations as
seem only to concern those that are under the immediate trouble of
them</i>. He tempts Christ to cast himself down, and also by it, at least,
intends a delusion to the Jews. He tempts one man upon the back
of another. One is tempted to error; another by that man’s temptation
is tempted to atheism and rejecting of all religion. One man is
tempted to profaneness, another is tempted by that to an uncharitable
disrespect of him. It is easy to multiply instance of this.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIV_3">CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>That presumption was the chief design of this temptation.—Of tempting
to extremes.—What presumption is.—The several ways of presuming.—The
frequency of this temptation, in the generality of
professors, in hypocrites, despairing persons, and in the children
of God.—The reasons of Satan’s industry in this design.—His
deceitful contrivance in bringing about this sin.—Preservatives
against it.</i></p>


<p>Next to the preparation which Satan made for the second conflict,
already explained, the temptation intended offers itself to our view,
which is this, ‘Cast thyself down.’ What Satan chiefly intended by
it, we may collect from Christ’s answer, as well as from the thing
itself; for he thus replies, ‘It is written, Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God.’ Christ doth not use this scripture to any such sense
as this, that he should hereby prohibit Satan to tempt him because he
was Satan’s Lord and God; but he mentioned this scripture as a rule
of obedience: as if he should say, ‘I may not cast myself down, and
so rely on extraordinary help, seeing I can go down another way;’ for
the neglect of ordinary means, when we have them, is a tempting of
God, which may not be done. So that it appears by this, that Satan
here tempted Christ to presumption. There is only this objection in
our way, that Deut. vi. 16, the place by Christ cited, refers to the
temptation of the Israelites in Massah, mentioned Exod. xvii. 2,
where they chide with Moses for water; and there it would seem their
tempting the Lord was rather in despairing of his power and help
than presuming in the neglect of the ordinary means. I answer,
though the occasion and matter of that temptation be different from
this of Christ’s, yet the presumptuous experiment that they there made
of God’s presence and power was the same with this which Satan
designed; for ver. 7, where the account of that tempting is given, it
is said, ‘because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among
us or not?’ they put it to this issue, that the being and power of God
should be tried by the giving or not giving of water. The manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
then, of that temptation being so agreeable to this, Christ very pertinently
applies that command to it, presumption being the thing
which Christ was tempted to. It might occasion some wonder in us
to see Satan take such strange steps. He was before tempting him to
despair, now to presumption; but it is no argument of his lightness or
uncertain roving in his way of tempting, but rather of his depth and
subtlety. Note then,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 7. <i>That it is Satan’s policy in tempting, to run from one extreme
to another.</i> The Corinthians were first tempted to a sinful
compliance with the adulterous person, and were averse to his excommunication;
afterwards they were tempted to the contrary severity,
and were as backward to receive him again. The same men that
have been overcome by prodigality and excess, when they begin to see
the evil of that, are oft tempted to worldliness or covetousness, the
contrary disposition. Reasons of this policy are:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>The avoiding of one extreme gives the soul such a swing,
if care be not used to prevent it, that they are cast more than half way
upon the other</i>. Peter, in an extreme of modesty, refused the washing
of his feet by Christ; but when he understood the danger, then he
runs as far wrong another way—‘Not my feet only, but my hands
and my head,’ John xiii. 9. Thus some are so for purity of churches,
that they exclude the weak; others so for unity, that they admit the
open scandalous and profane.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>While men avoid one extreme by running into
another, they carry with them such strong impressions of the evil
they would avoid, and such fierce prejudices, that it is not an ordinary
conviction will bring them right, but they are apt to be confident
of the goodness of the way they take, and so are the more bold and fixed
in their miscarriage</i>.</p>

<p>Presumption being the great design of Satan in this temptation, we
may further observe:—</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 8. <i>That as distrust on the one hand, so presumption on the
other, is one of his grand designs.</i> Of these two, we may say as it was
said of the sword of Hazael and Jehu, that of all those that are slain
by the devil, whosoever hath escaped the sword of distrust and despair,
the sword of presumption hath slain. To explain this I shall,</p>

<p>1. First, <i>Shew what presumption is</i>. It is in the general <i>a confidence
without a ground</i>. [1.] <i>First</i>, It is made up of <i>audacity</i>—which
is a bold and daring undertaking of a thing—and <i>security</i>. [2.]
<i>Secondly</i>, The ground of it is <i>an error of judgment</i>. A blind or a
misled judgment doth always nourish it; and this is either a mistake
of the nature of such means on which we rely for assistance, as when
a man lays as much stress upon a thread as upon a cable, or expects
as much nourishment from a stone as from bread;<a id="FNanchor_410_410" href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> or a mistake of
the will of others, from whom we expect aid and help, without a warrant
for such a confidence. [3.] <i>Thirdly</i>, In its way of working <i>it is
directly opposite to distrust, and is a kind of excessive though irregular
hope</i>; not that in this case a man believes or hopes overmuch, for
there can be no excess properly in the exercise of divine graces, but
that he hopes too rashly or lightly, without a solid foundation or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
reason.<a id="FNanchor_411_411" href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> Hope hath for its object that which is good under the considerations
of futurity, possibility, and difficulty. On the one side,
desperation looks upon that good as future, but under so great a difficulty
that it forgets the possibility of it, and thereupon surceaseth all
endeavours. Presumption, on the other hand, is so keenly apprehensive
of the possibility, that it never regards the difficulty, and so
thrusts forward into irregular endeavours or expectations. The nature
of this will be better understood when the particular instances of presumption
are before us.</p>

<p>(1.) First, Then it is presumption, <i>when from external or subordinate
means men expect that for which they were never designed
nor appointed of God</i>. To expect ‘grapes of thorns or figs of
thistles,’ would be a presumption, because God never designed them
for such fruits; and no less is it when in any other case men look for
high and extraordinary things from any created good above what God
hath put into it by the law of creation.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>When men do expect those fruits and effects from
anything unto which it is appointed, in neglect or opposition to the
supreme cause, without whose concurrent influence they cannot reach
their proper ends</i>—that is, our hopes are wholly centred upon means,
when in the meantime our eye is not upon God. Thus ‘to make gold
our hope,’ Job xxxi. 24, ‘to make flesh our arm,’ Jer. xvii. 5, ‘to make
Ashur a saviour,’ Hosea xiv. 3, or to trust to any creatures whatsoever,
is in Scripture condemned as a presumptuous reliance, and, in
regard of the necessary disappointment, ‘a trusting in a lie;’ in which
sense it is said that ‘every man is a liar,’ Ps. lxii. 9. The like presumption
it is when we boast great things of ourselves, and, as Peter,
make confident engagements, in our own strength, that we will avoid
such a sin or perform such a duty; for we are but frail, and all our
sufficiency is from the Lord, so that it can be no less than intolerable
arrogance to promise anything of ourselves without him; neither can
men promise to themselves the continuance of that good or advantage
which they have already received from second causes, if their confidence
builds itself upon that sole consideration, without a just blame.
Job had said he should ‘die in his nest,’ [chap. xxix. 18,] and David
that ‘he should never be moved,’ [Ps. xvi. 8,] but both of them afterward
noted these confidences to have been no other than deceitful
presumptions.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, It is a presumption <i>to expect things above the reach of
our present state and condition</i>; as for a mean man to beg of God
authority and rule, or to expect to be set with princes; or for ordinary
Christians to look for miracles, signs from heaven, visions,
revelations, extraordinary answers to prayers, and the like, all which
expectations are groundless, and the issue of a presumptuous pride:
<i>sperare non speranda</i>.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>When men expect things contrary to the rules that
God hath set for his dispensations of mercy, they boldly presume upon
his will</i>. God hath promised preservation to his children while they
are in God’s way, but if any shall go out of that way, and sinfully put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
himself into dangers and hazards, it would be presumption in him to
expect a preservation. It is the same in spiritual things. God promiseth
eternal life and the blessings of his covenant to such as give
up themselves to him and his laws; will it not be intolerable presumption
for men ‘to bless themselves in their heart’ with expectations of
reigning with him in glory, while in the meantime they contradict his
own rule and neglect his order, walking in profaneness and living to
themselves? This is a high presumption of mercy against his express
will. Hence are such courses called ‘presumptuous sins,’ Ps. xix. 13,
and such sinners transgress ‘with a high hand.’</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, It is also a presumption <i>to expect any mercy, though
common and usual, without the ordinary means by which God in providence
hath settled the usual dispensations of such favours</i>; as when
men look for his aid and help for supply of corporal wants, while they
throw off all care, and refuse their own endeavours, which are the ways
of God’s appointment, in the conscientious use whereof such mercies
are to be expected. The heathen, upon the consideration of the necessary
connexion of means and the end, have usually judged such
sluggish expectations to be no better than solemn mockings of a
deity: <i>admotâ manu invocanda est Minerva</i>. In spiritual things it
is no less presumptuous to expect conversion, and an interest in Christ
and heaven, while they refuse the careful use of his ordinances; and
therefore we are commanded to pray for such blessings, ‘to cry after
knowledge, and to lift up the voice for understanding,’ Prov. ii. 3-5,
and to second these prayers with our own utmost endeavours ‘to seek
for it as for silver, and to search for it as for hid treasures,’ and in so
doing to expect the finding of the knowledge of God.</p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, <i>When ordinary or extraordinary mercies are expected
for an unlawful end</i>; as when the Israelites at Massah called for water,—which
they ought to believe God would supply them withal, their condition
considered,—but for a test and proof of the being of God; for
they said, ‘Is God among us, or not?’ Exod. xvii. 7. It is by James
made a piece of spiritual unfaithfulness and adultery to ask anything
of God with a design ‘to spend it upon a lust,’ [chap. iv. 3.] Ahaz
his refusing a sign when God offered it, however he made a show of
modesty and believing, argued no other thing but that he was conscious
to himself that, in case he had accepted it, he should have
abused that favour to an unlawful end, and have tempted God by it,
as putting it upon this experiment whether there was a God or not.
This is also another act of presumption. When a man becomes
guilty of any of these miscarriages, he is presumptuous.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, I further add to this discovery of the nature and kinds
of presumption, that this is one of Satan’s grand engines; which I
prove by two demonstrations:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>By Satan’s common practice in this kind upon all sorts
of men, in most occasions</i>. That which is his frequent practice upon
most men, and on most occasions, must of necessity be understood to
be chiefly designed. Some men may possibly be free from the trouble
of some particular temptations, as Hieronimus Wallerus saith of
Luther his master, that he heard him often report of himself that he
had been assaulted and vexed with all kind of temptations, saving only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
that of covetousness; but none can say they have not been assaulted
with this. I shall make it out by an induction of particulars:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>The generality of men that live in the profession of religion
are presumptuous, nay, the greatest part of the blind world are
so</i>. They presume of mercy and salvation. The devil preacheth
nothing else but all hope, no fear, and in these golden dreams they
slide down to hell. If we look into their way of sinning, and then
into their hopes, we can judge no less of them. They stick not at the
most grievous abominations, the works of the flesh, and in these they
continue. It is their trade, their life; they make provisions for them,
they cannot sleep except they do wickedly; he that reproveth is derided
by them; they make but a mock and sport of those things
which, as the shame and reproach of mankind, should rather fly the
light and hide themselves as things of darkness. These things they
practise without regret or sorrow of heart, without smiting upon the
thigh, and in all this they have the confidence to say, ‘Is not the Lord
among us?’ They can call themselves Christians, and have as bold
expectations of eternal happiness, as if the committing of these evils
were made by God the necessary qualifications to everlasting happiness.
What is more common, and yet what more presumptuous?
For (1.) These men audaciously hope and expect mercy, expressly
contrary to the peremptory threatenings of God. God saith, ‘There is
no peace to the wicked;’ they say, ‘We shall have peace.’ (2.) These
run upon the greatest hazards of ruin and woe, with the least fear, in
the contempt of all danger, ‘as the horse rusheth into the battle, who
mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted, neither turneth his back from
the sword,’ Job xxxix. 22. (3.) They dare God to do his worst, they
provoke God to jealousy, and that to his face; hence was it that
Nimrod was said to be a mighty hunter before the Lord, [Gen. x. 9;]
and Er, the son of Judah, that he was wicked ‘before the Lord,’
[Gen. xxxviii. 7,] because such audacious sinners will not, as we may
say, go behind his back to sin.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Hypocrites whose carnage is more smooth, they also
are presumptuous</i>; for while they hide their sin, they do against dictates
of conscience presume ‘that he that made the eye doth not see,’
and that there is a possibility to cheat God as well as men: besides,
their boastings and hopes have a special mark set upon them in Scripture
as audaciously false; ‘the hope of the hypocrite shall be cut off,’
[Job viii. 13;] their confidence of the temple of the Lord is but a lie,
and so termed expressly by the prophet.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>Even despairing persons are not always free of presumption</i>.
The act of self-murder is a terrible presuming upon infinite
justice. Spira’s desire to know the worst was of the same kind.
These are indeed extraordinary; but there are some other kinds of
despair that come nearer to presumption, as that sensual despair which
ariseth out of an excessive love of carnal delights, and a secure contempt
of spiritual things; for when sensuality prompts them to eat
and drink while they may, despairing and hopeless of a future happiness,
‘for to-morrow they shall die,’ [Isa. xxii. 13,] and their pleasure
cease, they highly presume against the patience and goodness of God.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>The best of men are too frequently overcome by it</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
(1.) Not only while they are overtaken with sins more grievous, and
above the rate of sins of infirmity, to which how liable the holiest saint
may be upon temptation, may be gathered from David’s prayer, ‘Keep
thy servant from presumptuous sins, that they have not dominion over
me,’ [Ps. xix. 13.] (2.) But by their earnest prosecutions of their
own wills when contradicted by providence. It is by the prophet,
Isaiah ix. 9, called ‘a pride and stoutness of heart,’ to contend with
providence, to attempt to build with ‘hewn stone when the bricks are
fallen,’ or to ‘strive for cedars when divine wrath hath cut down the
sycamores.’ (3.) How frequently are they guilty of presuming upon
their privileges, their strength, their graces, and upon that score venture
themselves upon occasions of sin, or bear high above others upon
a conceit of their higher attainments, or when they boldly put themselves
upon suffering, or upon doing, while they want that due humility
and care that should balance them. (4.) There is also a presumptuous
rashness, upon which the zeal and good intentions of holy
men may sometimes precipitate them. Such was Uzziah’s putting
forth his hand to hold the ark, for which the Lord smote him. All
these instances put together will sufficiently demonstrate that presumption
is one of Satan’s master designs.</p>

<p>The second demonstration of this truth is from the general subserviency
of other things to this. Most of Satan’s endeavours and temptations
aim at this point, and this is the result and consequence of
most sins. That must needs be chief, to which so many things do but
serve and minister. In this centre do most of the lines of his policy
meet,—pride, vainglory, conceited privileges, supposed advantages,
and many things more were but under-agents to this temptation which
the devil attempted upon Christ, as hath in part, and presently shall
be further, evidenced.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, Having thus proved that presumption is one of the great
things he aims at, I shall next <i>discover the reasons of his earnestness
and industry in his design</i>, which are these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>It is a sin very natural, in which he hath the advantage
of our own readiness and inclination</i>. However that some from a
melancholy temper are inclinable to fears and distrust at some time,
when these black apprehensions are exalted, yet, these excepted, hopes
are more predominant than fears; and self-love, which provides fuel
to these hopes, is a natural principle in all. When so many things
give him such advantages and promise him a success, we may well
suppose he will not miss such an opportunity.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>As it is easy for Satan’s attempt, so it is remote from
conviction, and not rooted out without great difficulty</i>. It is a sin that
is covered with a pretext of a higher degree of hope. Men in many
ways of this iniquity are under persuasions of duty, and by reason of
that confidence, fear, which is the soul’s sentinel, is asleep. Hence
do they not lie so fairly open to counsel or reproof. The Israelites,
Deut. i. 27, 28, being under discouragement, refuse to go up to
Canaan, when they were upon the border of the land; but being convinced
of their sin in distrusting the arm of the Lord, by God’s
declared wrath and threatening against them, they fall upon the contrary
extreme of presumption, and then, ver. 41, ‘they would go up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
and fight;’ and the conviction of their former sin made them so confident
that this was their present duty—for thus they argue, ‘We have
sinned against the Lord, we will go up and fight, according to all that
the Lord our God commanded us’—that though they were expressly
forbidden from God, ver. 42, ‘Go not up, neither fight, for I am not
among you;’ yet were they so strangely carried by their former persuasion,
that they refused to be convinced, ‘and went presumptuously
into the hill.’ By which instance we see what great pretences lead on
presumption, and how difficultly they are removed, which two things
do no less than tempt Satan to lay out himself to the uttermost in that
design.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>The greatness of the sin when it is committed, is another
reason of his diligence in the pursuit of it</i>. It is not only from a
simple error or mistake, but that error ariseth from intolerable pride;
they say and do such things from the pride and stoutness of their
heart, Isa. ix. 9. He that is presumptuous is self-willed, 2 Pet. ii.
10. Hence these sins, which we translate presumptuous, are in the
original called prides or arrogancies, Ps. xix. 13; Deut. xvii. 12. Besides,
they are contradictions to Gods order, separating those things
that God hath joined together, as the means from the end, or the
end from the means, as if the ‘earth should be turned out of its place’
for us. And in some cases it is no less than the open affronting of
God by abusing his own favours against himself; for thus they deal
with him, who are opinionated in sin because of his mercy, concluding,
by an irrational consequence, that they ought to be wicked because
God is good, or that they may freely offend because he doth not punish.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>The dangerous issues and consequences of this way of
sinning, do not a little animate Satan to tempt to it</i>. In some cases it
was to be punished by death: Deut. xvii. 12, ‘The man that doth
presumptuously, even that man shall die;’ and most usually it is
plagued with sad disappointments, by a severe engagement of God’s
displeasure against it. ‘The hypocrite’s hope shall perish, it shall be
as the giving up of the ghost,’ Job viii. 13, and xi. 20. And generally,
‘He that thus blesseth himself in his heart, when he heareth the
words of the curse,’ Deut. xxix. 19, 20, ‘the Lord will not spare
him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke
against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall
lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven.’</p>

<p>4. Fourthly and lastly, I shall lay before you <i>the deceitful contrivance
of Satan in bringing this sin about</i>, by shewing the particulars of
his craft against Christ herein. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>He takes advantage from his resolve to rely upon providence,
contrary to the former temptation of turning stones to bread</i>.
Christ had refused that, telling him it was duty to trust him, who not
only by the ordinary means of bread could feed him, but also by any
other appointment. To this Satan rejoins, by offering an irregular
opportunity of such a trust, in casting himself from the pinnacle of the
temple: as if he should say, ‘If thou wilt thus rely upon providence,
do it in this.’ Wherein we may note, that from an obediential dependence,
he would draw Christ to an irregular presumption. He retorts
Christ’s argument back again upon him thus, ‘If God is to be relied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
upon by a certain trust for food, by the like trust he is to be relied
upon for preservation; if the belief of supply of bread can consist with
a neglect or refusal of ordinary means for the procurement thereof,
then may the belief of preservation in casting thyself from the pinnacle
of the temple consist also with a neglect of the ordinary means.’ Thus,
like a cunning sophister, he endeavours to conclude sin from duty,
from a seeming parity betwixt them, though indeed the cases were
vastly different. For, though it be duty to depend upon providence,
when God, in the pursuit of service and duty, brings us out of the
sight and hopes of outward means, yet it can be no less than sinful
presumption for us to make such experiments of providences, when
we need not, and when ordinary means are at hand. After the same
manner doth he endeavour to put fallacies upon us, and to cheat us
into presumptuous undertakings, by arguing from a necessary trust,
in some cases, a necessity of presuming in others, upon a seeming
likeness and proportion.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>It was no small piece of Satan’s craft to take this
advantage, while the impression of trust in the want of outward means
was warm upon the heart of Christ</i>. He hoped thereby the more easily
to draw him to an excess. For he knows that a zealous earnestness to
avoid a sin, and to keep to a duty, doth often too much incline us to
an extreme, and he well hoped that when Christ had declared himself
so positively to depend upon God, he might have prevailed to have
stretched that dependence beyond its due bounds, taking the opportunity
of his sway that way, which, as a ship before wind and tide,
might soon be overdriven. And this was the design of his haste in
this second temptation, because he would strike while the iron was
hot, and closely pursue his advantage, while the strength and forwardness
of these resolves were upon him.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>He endeavours to animate him to this presumption by
popular applause, and to tickle him into a humour of affecting the glory
and admiration, which by such a strange undertaking might be raised
in the minds of the spectators</i>; and therefore did he bring him to the
most conspicuous place of a great and populous city, not thinking the
matter so feasible if he had tempted him to it in a solitary desert.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>He propounds to him a plausible end, and a seeming
advantage</i>, viz., the clear and undoubted discovery of his divine nature
and near interest in God; urging this as a necessary duty, for his
own satisfaction, and the manifestation of his sonship to others.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, To drive out of his mind those fears of miscarrying in
his attempt, which otherwise might have been a block in his way, <i>he
is officious in strengthening his confidence by propounding treacherous
helps and preservatives</i>, suggesting a safety to him from the privilege
of the place where this was to be acted, a holy city and temple, producing
more of a divine presence for his safety than other places.</p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, To make all sure, <i>he backs all this with a promise of
preservation</i>, that nothing might be wanting to his security.</p>

<p>By this method applied to other things and cases, he endeavours
to bring us to presumption.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> The consideration of this should <i>put us upon a special care
and watchfulness against presumption</i>. It is more designed, and hath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
a greater prevalency than men are aware of. Two things I shall only
at present propound for our preservation, out of Ps. xix. 12, 13.</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>He that would be kept from presumptuous sins must make
conscience of secret sins, to search for them, to mortify them, to beg
pardon for them</i>. With what face or hope can we expect from God
help against these, when we provoke him to leave us to ourselves, by
indulging ourselves in the other?</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, He that would avoid them <i>must be under the awe and
fear of being overcome by them</i>. He that slights and contemns such
visible hazards shall not long be innocent. David here first shews his
conscience to be concerned with secret sins, and then begs to be kept
from presumptuous sins, and by such earnest begging he next shews
how much he dreaded such miscarriages. [Dickson, <i>in loc.</i>]</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XV_3">CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Self-murder another of his designs in this temptation.—How he tempts
to self-murder directly, and upon what advantage he urgeth it.—How
he tempts to it indirectly, and the ways thereof.—Of necessary preservatives
against this temptation.</i></p>


<p>We have seen and considered the main end of Satan in this temptation.
Let us further consider whether this was the sole end that he
propounded to himself. We have little reason to think that he would
confine himself to one, when the thing itself doth so clearly suggest
another, which might possibly have followed. In most cases, the ends
of the devil are manifold. We may therefore easily suppose—and
several have noted it<a id="FNanchor_412_412" href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a>—that the devil, that great murderer, had herein
a secret design against the life of Christ, and that he tempted him
here indirectly to self-murder. And indeed, supposing that Christ
had attempted to fly in the air, and had failed in the enterprise, what
else could have followed but death and ruin? Hence let us note,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 9. <i>That Satan seeks the ruin of our bodies as well as of our
souls, and tempts men often to self-murder.</i> That the devil goes about
seeking how he may destroy men, by putting them upon attempts
against their own lives, is evident, not only from the experience and
confessions of such as have suffered under Satan’s suggestions to that
end—and it is a temptation more common than we think of, because
most men are unwilling to lay open themselves to others in this matter—but
also from those many sad instances of men over whom Satan
so far prevails, that they execute upon themselves this design by destroying
themselves. Yet by the way we may note, that such thoughts
are often in the minds of men where Satan is not industriously designing
their destruction; for he often casts in such thoughts, not only to
try how men take with them, but to affright and disquiet them; and
it is usual with men of sad and melancholy tempers to mistake their
own fears of such a temptation, for Satan’s endeavours against them,
when indeed their fear and trouble lest they should be so tempted,
makes them think they are tempted indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

<p>Satan drives on the design of self-murder two ways:—</p>

<p>1. First, <i>Directly, when in plain terms he urgeth men to destroy
themselves</i>. This because it is directly repugnant to the law of nature,
which vehemently urgeth them to self-preservation, he cannot effect
but by the help of some advantages; yet some ways and methods by
experience he hath found to be so available to such an unnatural resolve,
that he frequently puts them in practice. As, (1.) first, He works
upon <i>the discontents of men</i>, and improves the disquiet of their minds,
upon the occasion of any loss, vexation, disappointment, or disgrace,
to as great a height as he can, and when their lives are made bitter to
them, and they are sufficiently prepared by the uneasiness of their
condition, then he propounds death as the only remedy to set them at
quiet; wherein, besides his officiousness to provide them with instruments
of cruelty and opportunity for their use, he follows them with
arguments drawn from the sense of their present condition; the great
intendment whereof is to aggravate their smart, and to make their
burden seem intolerable, and then self-ruin is but a natural consequence.
We may see enough of this in the discontents of good men,
and that they naturally work this way. Job speaks the general apprehensions
of men in trouble, chap. iii. 20, 21, ‘The bitter in soul value
not life; they long for death, and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
they rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the
grave.’ Jonah in his discontent prefers death before life: ‘It is better
for me to die than to live,’ [chap. iv. 3.] Elias doth the like; and
Job seems impatient for it. All this is from the power and working
of this temptation, though God held their hand that it did not fully
prevail. In Ahithophel the ground of discontent was more a fancied
than a real disgrace; his counsel was rejected—which was in itself no
great dishonour—and this works up such a perplexing resentment in
his mind, that Satan prevails with him to hang himself very deliberately.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>He most frequently draws on men to destroy themselves
by terrors and despairing troubles of conscience</i>. These, as they afford
greater disquiet and distress of mind than other kind of discontentments,
so doth he more prevail by them; for a wounded spirit is above
ordinary strength, and hard to bear; only it may seem strange that
those who so experimentally feel how ‘fearful a thing it is to fall into
the hands of the living God,’ [Heb. x. 31,] should entertain such a
temptation as, to their apprehensions and knowledge, will certainly
plunge them into the very ocean of everlasting vengeance. This no
doubt Satan finds to be no small obstruction to his design; but here
he useth his skill to open a way for them that would outrun their
lives on the one hand, as he labours to pursue them with sense of
wrath and indignation on the other hand. To this purpose he tells
them, [1.] That all the hell they are to meet with is in their consciences,
and that death will free them from all, or at least that death will give
a present ease, and that till the resurrection they shall be in quiet.
Those that are willing to receive these apprehensions may easily be
prevailed with to hasten their own death, seeing they have already
fixed this conclusion with themselves, that there is no hope nor pardon
for them, that they are reprobates and cut off; for their thoughts can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
meditate nothing but the terrors of such conclusions. [2.] He sometimes
endeavours to persuade them, that by executing this revenge
upon themselves, they may make some kind of satisfaction and amends
for the sins they have committed; which though most false, yet it is
a wonder how far such ungrounded surmises may possess the minds
of the desperate. That Judas might have some such thought when
he destroyed himself, is conjectured by some;<a id="FNanchor_413_413" href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> but that must be but a
conjecture, seeing none can pretend to know his thoughts; but we
may speak with greater freedom of those who have declared the working
of such apprehensions upon their minds. [3.] A more plausible
pretext he useth when he endeavours to persuade them that they may
kill themselves, and yet go to heaven for all that. To this purpose
the subtle adversary is not backward to tell them what have been the
charitable expressions of some men who have supposed a possibility of
repentance <i>inter pontem et fontem</i>, as we say, betwixt the stroke or
halter and the death. Capel is so apprehensive of the mischievous
improvement of this charity, for an encouragement to self-murder,
that he with great earnestness cautions all ministers against such
liberal expressions.<a id="FNanchor_414_414" href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> I have known some, and heard of others, that
have been so possessed with this imagination of being saved, notwithstanding
that having purposed to destroy themselves—though God
prevented them that they did it not—they have first by prayer recommended
themselves to God, and so prepared themselves to die. [4.]
Sometime, though such afflicted ones have no such persuasion but
that from death they go immediately to hell, yet are they pushed
forward by a certain fearful curiosity of knowing the worst. At that
rate did Spira express himself, when he desired to be freed of his life
that he might know the utmost of those torments which he feared;
as if the affrightments of his fearful expectations were worse than
the real feeling of them. [5.] But most of all doth he prevail against
that objection of greater misery after death, by running men up to a
desperate distraction in their terrors. Their present anguish is made
insupportable, so that they hasten out of life, without care or consideration
of what shall follow.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>He tempts men directly to destroy themselves from a
principle of heroic boldness and seeming fortitude of mind</i>—a thing
very common among the Romans, who impatient of injuries, and from
pride of heart, not willing to subject themselves to affronts, chose
rather to tear their own bowels than to live to see themselves abused.
Lucretia being forced by Tarquinius, and not willing to outlive her
disgrace, stabbed herself. Cato, not being able to endure the victory
of Cæsar, puts an end to his days. Innumerable instances of this
kind histories do everywhere afford. These, though they consulted
their own passions, and knew of nothing that prompted them but
their own generosity or magnanimity, yet were they not without a
tempter to such cruel actions. Satan undoubtedly pleased himself by
exercising his cruelty upon them so easily, by the help of such a
humour, which passed among these blind heathens for the highest
proof of virtue and fortitude. To this height it came, insomuch that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
we find Seneca highly applauding Cato<a id="FNanchor_415_415" href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> for procuring his liberty by
his own death; and setting forth that fact as the most delightful spectacle
to the gods. Though indeed, as Augustine notes,<a id="FNanchor_416_416" href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> it is not fortitude
but weakness, and a clear evidence of impatience, which cannot
bear other men’s insolencies or their own hardships. And if we
examine the matter to the bottom, though there be audacity in it to
undertake their own death, yet is this led on by no better principles
than pride, impatience, and despair: which may the better be discovered
if we consider such kind of attempts as they arise from more
ignoble and base occasions. Paterculus tells us of a Tuscan soothsayer,
who being carried to prison with his friend Fulvius Flaccus,
and despairing of pardon, desperately runs his head against the prison
door and dashed out his brains; and yet this man was moved to
attempt his destruction upon the same general principles by which
Cato destroyed himself.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, It is also sufficiently known that Satan <i>by the force
of custom in several countries, doth as it were necessitate men to cut off
their own lives</i>. In some barbarous places, at the death of the husband,
the wife, in a brutal affection of the praise of love and loyalty,
casts herself to be devoured by the same flame in which the dead body
of her husband is consumed.<a id="FNanchor_417_417" href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> And there are found in other places
customs of self-destruction for the avoiding the tedious inconveniences
of old age, where it is usual for old persons with joy to prepare their
own funeral pile, and to make a quick despatch of their lives, and
rather to die at once than by piecemeal, as Seneca expresseth it.<a id="FNanchor_418_418" href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a>
Calanus, an Indian philosopher, being dysenterical, obtained leave of
Alexander to burn himself for more quick despatch.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, There is yet another way by which men are tempted
sometime, though rarely, to hasten themselves out of the world, and
that is by <i>a pretence of an earnest and impatient desire of happiness
to come</i>. That longings for such enjoyments do become the best of
saints, and is indeed their excellency, cannot be denied; but to make
such a preposterous haste must be a cheat of Satan. That there is a
possibility of this, may appear in the story of Cleombrotus, mentioned
also by Augustine, who reading Plato’s ‘Phædo, of the Immortality of
the Soul,’ that he might hasten thither, threw himself headlong from
a wall, and died.<a id="FNanchor_419_419" href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> Now, though it be hard to find such an instance
among Christians, yet we have reason to believe that where Satan
perceives such a temptation may take place, he will not be wanting in
the prosecution. And if we may conjecture Augustine’s thoughts by
that question which he propounds—viz., Whether it be lawful for a
man to kill himself for the avoiding of sin, which he solidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
confutes,<a id="FNanchor_420_420" href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> we may conclude that such thoughts were the usual temptations
of good men in his time, and the rather because in the close of
that chapter he applies that discourse particularly to the servants of
Christ, that they should not think their lives a burden. <i>Non itaque
vobis, O fideles Christi, sit tœdio vita vestra.</i></p>

<p>2. Secondly, Satan promotes the design of self-murder, not only
directly, as we have heard, but also <i>by some indirect ways he undermines
the life of man</i>. That is, when he doth not formally say to
them, Destroy yourselves, but tempts them to such things as he
knows will let in upon death. This way of subtle malice I shall
explain under these heads:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>Upon highest pretexts of zeal for Gods glory, he sometimes
lays a snare for our lives</i>. I cannot believe but Satan had a
hand in that forwardness of ancient Christians, who by an open profession
of their faith before persecuting judicatures, did as it were court
a martyrdom; and I have the same persuasion of the painful earnestness
of many holy preachers, who lavish out their strength in a prodigality
of pains for the good of souls, which, like a thief in the candle,
wastes them immediately; whereas a better husbanded strength might
be truly more advantageous, as continuing the light the longer; and
yet so sincere are their ends, so pleasant is their work, that they seldom
observe, as they ought, that Satan, when he can do no better, is glad
of the opportunity to destroy them with their own weapon; and therefore
in this case they may expect he will do all he can to heighten
and forward their zeal, not only by adding all the fuel he can to their
inward propensity of laboriousness, but also by outward encouragement
of the declared acceptations and expectations of their hearers.<a id="FNanchor_421_421" href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>Upon baser pretences of the full enjoyment of sensual
pleasures and carnal delights, he doth unawares push men forward to
death and dangers</i>. Thus the voluptuous, the glutton, the drunkard,
dig their own graves, and invite death to cut them off before they
have lived out half their time. While Satan tempts men to such
excesses of riot, he labours not only the destruction of the soul, but
also of the body; not only that they be miserable, but that they may
be so with all expedition.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Besides all these, <i>he hath other subtle ways of contriving
the death of men, by putting them upon ways and actions that
are attended with hazard</i>. Thus he sought the death of Christ, not
directly but indirectly, by urging him to an action which he thought
would unavoidably bring him to death, for a fall from so great a precipice
would easily have bereaved any man of life. And sometimes
when men are besotted with enthusiastical delusions, he can more
easily beguile them with such stratagems. That instance of Stuker<a id="FNanchor_422_422" href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a>
is famous, who cut off his brother’s head upon a foolish persuasion
that God would magnify his great power in giving him life again. If
Satan can befool such bewitched slaves into such absurd and unreasonable
apprehensions in regard of others, what hinders but that he
may so far impose upon them, that they may be willing to practise
upon themselves? I remember something to this purpose, of one whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
the devil had well-nigh prevailed with to make a hole in his breast,
which of necessity must have let out his life, upon a pretended promise
of giving him eternal life, and was accordingly forced to take up a
knife and to carry it to his throat.<a id="FNanchor_423_423" href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> In <i>anno</i> 1647, in Yorkshire, a
company of people were seduced to sacrifice certain creatures to God,
among the rest they sacrificed their aged mother, persuading her she
should rise the third day, and for this they were executed at York.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> <i>This may awaken all to be aware of this temptation.</i> Some
are sadly concerned in it. Many are the complaints which some of
us have met withal about it in private, and the apprehensions of such
hazards are sadly disquieting. Through such fears thousands of God’s
dear children have passed, and many, too many, have been overcome
by this weapon. Those of us that have not yet known temptations of
this nature, do not know how soon we may be assaulted in this kind.
It is necessary for all to stand upon their guard, and for that end it
behoves us to have at hand these defences against it:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, It is useful to consider <i>that this is one of Satan’s great
plots</i>; and when we meet with it clothed with never so many pretexts,
enforced with never so many seeming necessities, yet must we look upon
it as the counsel of an enemy, who certainly intends us no kindness,
let him pretend what he will; and therefore may we be sure it will be
our sad inconvenience and disadvantage.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, It must be fixed in our minds <i>that the thing in itself
is a high iniquity, a most grievous provocation</i>. No instance of self-murder,
properly such, can be met withal in Scripture, as practised by
any holy person. The command is directly against it, ‘Thou shalt
not kill.’ If we may not murder another, as Austin argues, we may
not murder ourselves; for he that kills himself kills no other than a
man; nay, we may much less lay hand upon our own life.<a id="FNanchor_424_424" href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> It is a
greater violation of the law of nature and of love. Every man is
nearest to himself; and his love to himself is the pattern of his love to
another. Self-murder must then be a sin of higher aggravations by
far than the murder of another person. And the wiser heathens were
far from countenancing any such cruelty. If Plato had thought it
best, for an immediate enjoyment of immortality, which is the highest
pretence of self-murder imaginable, to make an end of life violently,
he would certainly have practised it himself, or recommended it to
others, but he is so far from this, that he speaks against it as a great
wickedness.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, It is necessary that men keep in mind <i>the danger that
follows such an act</i>. Death brings God’s unalterable <i>mittimus</i>, and
seals up the condition of every man, so that in the same posture he
comes to judgment, it puts an end to all hopes and endeavours. Suppose
then such tempted creatures to have fears and terrors as great as
you can imagine them to be, yet there is a possibility that they may
be deceived in them, that their case is not so bad as they fear, or if it
be bad enough at present, that it may be better afterwards; for many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
that have in their anguish resolved against themselves, have been prevented
of the execution of their resolves, and have lived to see the Lord
and his salvation. And who is able to determine that secret, that their
name is not in the book of life? Who can say he is certainly excluded
out of God’s decree? What madness is it then to rush into certain
ruin, when our fears that distress us may be but mistakes! It is not
so certain that men shall be damned, because of what they feel or fear
at present, as it may be if they destroy themselves.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, To prevent occasions to this temptation, <i>it must be
our care not to give way to discontents for outward things, nor to distressing
fears, such as are despairing and hopeless, for our spiritual
estate</i>; or if we have a burden either way upon our mind, we must
avoid as much as may be impatient fretfulness, ‘lest Satan get
advantage of us.’ Discontented moods and casting away hope are
sad occasions for this temptation. If we find ourselves thus burdened,
we must look to it betimes, and not suffer it to go too far. And if
this temptation come, we must take heed we keep not the devil’s
counsel, but discover the matter to some that are wise and faithful,
able to advise and pray for us; remembering still that if only outward
things trouble us, we have a better way of ease and remedy, by submitting
to a chastising providence. If spiritual troubles move this
way, we should not run from him, but rather resolve to perish at his
foot as humble suppliants for mercy and pardon.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, The temptation must also be opposed with <i>fasting
and prayer</i>. If this be sincerely practised, it will go away at last.</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, Something may also be said for caution against <i>unnecessary
thrusting ourselves, while under such temptations, into places
of danger, or into a converse with instruments of death</i>. This may be
too great a daring of the temptation, and in the consequence a mischief.
Yet on the other hand, we must not be so cowardly as to be
afraid of such places and things, unto which our callings and lawful
employments do engage us; not to dare to go over a bridge, or to
walk by a river or a pit, if it be our necessary way, is but to give an
advantage to Satan to keep us under continual affrightments; and
therefore I subscribe to Capel’s advice, ‘We must abide by it, and
fight it out by faith; we must not fly the way, the place, the employment,
but go on and look to God, and at last we shall make Satan
fly.’<a id="FNanchor_425_425" href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But if some object to this, that their weakness is great, and
their fears are strong, and Satan never idle, and that therefore they
have little ground to expect an escape, I shall desire they would consider
seriously the instance of Christ in this particular. When he
was upon the pinnacle of the temple, a small push might have overthrown
him, and yet it was not in Satan’s power to do it himself,
though he tempted Christ to cast himself down: which may sufficiently
satisfy us, that there is a sure hedge of providence about us,
and that Satan cannot do us the least hurt by pushing us into a pit
or river, or any such danger.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVI_3">CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of pride, Satan’s chief engine to bring on presumption.—What pride
is, and how it prepares men for sinning presumptuously.—Considerations
against pride.—The remedies for its cure.—Pride
kindled by a confidence of privileges and popular applause.</i></p>


<p>The aims of Satan in this temptation being thus explained, I must
now offer to your consideration the means by which he sought to
bring his end about, which we have noted already, was pride: this he
endeavoured to raise up in him two ways:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, By urging to him the privileges of his condition, as
taking himself to be the Son of God.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, By offering him the occasion of popular applause;
to which purpose he brought him into the holy city, where he might
be sure of many spectators. I shall hence note,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 10. <i>That pride is Satan’s proper engine to bring men on to
presumption.</i></p>

<p>If we should trace the history of presumptuous sins, we shall ever
find it to have been so. Adam’s first sin was a high presumption
against God’s express command, but pride was the stair by which he
knew they must ascend to it; and therefore he used this argument
to corrupt the hearts of our first parents, ‘Ye shall be as gods.’ The
presumption of Uzziah in burning incense upon the altar, was from
his pride, 2 Chron. xxvi. 16, ‘His heart was lifted up, because he was
become strong.’ David’s presumption in numbering the people was
from hence. Thus might we run through many instances. But
Satan’s own case may be instead of all. His first sin, though we
have but conjecture what it was particularly, is concluded by all to
have been highly presumptuous, and the Scripture expressly asserts
that it was his pride that brought him to it. 1 Tim. iii. 6, ‘He that
is lifted up with pride, falls into the condemnation of the devil.’ And
in the general we are told by the prophet, Hab. ii. 4, ‘that the soul
that is lifted up,’ cannot be so upright as patiently to wait upon God
in a way of believing, but it will be presuming to evade a trouble by
indirect contrivances.</p>

<p>To explain the observation, I shall do no more but shew what pride
is, and how fit it is to beget presumption.</p>

<p><i>Pride is a self-idolising, an over-valuation or admiration of ourselves,
upon a real or supposed excellency, inward or outward, appertaining
to us.</i> It is in Scripture frequently expressed by the lifting
up or exaltation of the soul. And this is done, upon the consideration
of any kind of thing, which we apprehend makes us excel others;
so that inward gifts of mind, as knowledge, humility, courage, &amp;c.,
or outward gifts of the body, as beauty, strength, activity, &amp;c., or
additional advantages of riches, honour, authority, &amp;c., or anything
well done by us, &amp;c., may all be abused to beget and nourish pride,
and to fill us with high and lofty thoughts concerning ourselves; and
being thus blown up, we are fitted for any presumptuous undertaking.
For,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span></p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>The mind thus corrupted begets to itself apprehensions
of a self-sufficiency</i>: and therefore, as it is not apt to remember from
what fountain all those excellencies come, and to what ends they are
to serve; so it brings them to a contempt of others, and to a confidence
of themselves. Thus are men by degrees so intoxicated by their
own humour, that they mount up to irrational and absurd conceits,
fancying that they are more than they are, and that they can do far
more than is possible for them to accomplish, till at last they become
apparently foolish in the pursuit of their imaginations. I need not
instance in the follies of Alexander, who being elated in mind, would
be Jupiter’s son, and go like Hercules in a lion’s skin. Or in the mad
frenzies of Caius, who as he would need fancy himself a god, so would
he change his godship when he pleased: to-day he would wear a lion’s
skin and club, and then he must be Hercules; to-morrow in another
garb he conceits himself Apollo; a caduceus made him Mercury, a
sword and helmet made him Mars, &amp;c. Or in Xerxes, who would
whip the seas, and fetter Neptune. The Scripture affords enough of
this nature, as the boast of Nebuchadnezzar; ‘Is not this great Babel
that I have built?’ In the insolency of Nineveh, Zeph. ii. 15, ‘I
am, and there is none besides me.’ The blasphemy of Tyre, Ezek.
xxviii. 2, who set her heart ‘as the heart of God, saying, I am a
god, I sit in the seat of God.’ The arrogancy of Sennacherib, Isa.
xxxvi. 19, 20, ‘Where are the gods of Hamath ... that the Lord
should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’ Though all pride in all
men ariseth not to so great a height of madness, yet it is the nature
of it, and none have any of it without this humour of conceiting
themselves above themselves, which strangely prepares them for any
presumption.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, He that is proud, <i>as he looks upon himself in a
flattering glass, and measures himself by the length of his shadow; so
doth he contemn and undervalue things that lie before his attempts as
easy and small</i>. Hence doth he put himself upon things that are far
beyond him. David notes the working of a proud heart, Ps. cxxxi. 1,
in this particular, ‘Neither do I exercise myself in great matters,
or in things too high for me,’ shewing that it is the guise of pride to
outbid itself in its attempts.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>It is not only forward to attempt, but also desperate
to execute without consideration of hazard</i>. Difficulty and danger,
when they stand in the way, should usually deter men from their
enterprise; but pride hardens the heart, and, in a blind rage, engageth
it to contemn all inconveniencies. If sin and the breach of God’s law
be set before a person, whose pride engageth him to an unlawful
undertaking, he overlooks it as a thing of nought: ‘Through the
pride of his countenance he will not seek after God: God is not in all
his thoughts,’ Ps. x. 4.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, Pride ariseth up <i>to a scornful competition with anything
that opposeth it</i>; and the more it is opposed, the more it rageth,
for the contest is for having its will. This was the voice of pride
in Pharaoh, ‘Who is the Lord, that I should serve him?’ [Exod.
v. 2.] Hence men are said to ‘despise the commandments of God,’
[Lev. xxvi. 15,] when in the strength of their pride they are carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
on to an open contest for their own ways and desires against peremptory
commands and threatenings.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, All this is done by <i>a pleasing allurement</i>. It is a
witchcraft that strongly holds men, <i>Amabilis insania mentis gratissimus
error</i>; and they think they are sufficiently rewarded if they be
but gratified. Though other things go to wreck, yet they apprehend,
if credit and honour be kept up, it is enough. Saul, when Samuel had
declared that God would forsake him, yet sought to please himself by
keeping up his esteem and authority; ‘Honour me,’ saith he, ‘before
the people,’ [1 Sam. xv. 30.]</p>

<p>If all these particulars be weighed, what presumptuous act can be
propounded by Satan which pride may not lead to? He that swells
himself to a conceit of absoluteness, that will needs be attempting
things too high, that contemneth all hazards, and is made more
forward by opposition, and yet pleaseth himself in all, as in a golden
dream, he is as much prepared for any figure or shape that Satan
is ready to impress upon him, as melted metals for their mould or
stamp.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> <i>Hence must we be warned against pride, as we would avoid
presumption.</i> If we admit this, we cannot well escape the other.
And we are the more concerned to resist pride,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>Because it is a natural sin</i>. It was the first sin, and
our natures are so deeply tainted with it, that it is a sin that first
shews itself in our infancy; for children will express a pride in their
clothes very early, and it is a general infection, from which none are
exempted in some degree or other. The apostle’s phrase, 1 John ii. 16,
shews that our whole life, and all the concerns thereof, is but the
sphere in which pride acts; and therefore, whereas he restrains other
lusts to some particular ends or peculiar instruments, he calls this
iniquity the ‘pride of life,’ implying how impossible it is to confine it
in a narrow compass.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>It is a subtle sin, and often lies where it is least suspected</i>.
Every man sees it, as it is expressed in ‘haughty looks,’ in
‘boasting speeches,’ in ‘gorgeous apparel,’ in ‘insolent behaviour;’
but often men are insensibly possessed with this sin and know not
of it. Under an affected contempt of honours and fine clothes they
secretly hug themselves in their private conceits, and raise up in their
own thoughts imaginary trophies of honour and victory, for despising
what others so much dote upon. It was observed of Diogenes that he
did <i>intus gloriari</i>, inwardly boast, and with greater pride contemned
honour, riches, plenty, &amp;c., than they were troubled with that enjoyed
them. Some decry pride in others, vehemently declare against it as a
sin, recommend humility as an ornament of great price in the sight of
God, and yet are proud that they are above others in a fancied
humility; and, in the management of themselves in their reproofs and
exhortations, express such sad symptoms of an insulting humour, that
the latent pride of their heart doth appear by it. It is possible for
men to give thanks to the Almighty for all they have, and yet to
be proud of what is in them. The Pharisee was proud, for so Christ
calls him, that ‘he was not as other men,’ and yet he could ‘thank
God,’ as ascribing all to him; nay, he that is truly sensible of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
working of this pride in himself, and dares not approve it, yet he
shall find in his heart such a delight when he is stroked or praised;
and when some actions, praiseworthy, are not taken notice of, the best
shall find that, without great watchfulness, they shall not be able to
hold from giving some hints to others, as a memorial to them, of
observing their excellency, or from some insinuations of their own
commendation.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Pride is a sin <i>no less dangerous than subtle</i>. There
are no attempts so strange, unreasonable, monstrous, or absurd, but it
may prompt to them. It was a strange arrogancy in Herod to deify
himself in his own thoughts, and yet the acclamations of the people
swelled him into such a blasphemous imagination, that God thought
fit to chastise him, and instruct others by so dreadful a judgment,
as clearly baffled his insolency, and made him and his flatterers confess
he was but a poor, frail man. Ordinarily pride is attended with
a judgment, it is the very prognostic of ruin: ‘Pride goeth before
destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall,’ Prov. xvi. 18. But
these judgments have something in them peculiar, which other judgments
for other sins do not always express, to a manifestation of a
special abhorrency in God against pride; as, (1.) He commonly
smites the thing for which they are proud. Staupitius boasted of his
memory, and God smote it; Hezekiah boasted of his treasure, and for
that God designed them for captivity; David glorified [himself] in
the multitude of his people, but God lessened them by pestilence;
Nebuchadnezzar is proud of his Babel, and God drove him from the
enjoyment of it. Men are proud of children or relations, and God oft
removes them, or makes them a shame and sorrow. (2.) He doth
not only this, but also orders the judgment so that it shall bring a
shame and contempt upon men in that thing wherein they prided
themselves. He will not only punish, but also stain their pride.
The haughty daughters of Zion were not only plagued by removing
their ornaments, bracelets, and the rest of their bravery, but over and
above he ‘smites with a scab the crown of their head, and discovers
their secret parts, and brings a stink and baldness upon them instead
of a sweet smell and well-set hair, and burning instead of beauty,’
Isa. iii. 17, 24.</p>

<p>So sad a distemper stands in need of a special care; and for that
end we should,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>In all things we have or do, not so much consider what is
excellent, or wherein we excel, as what we have not, and wherein we
come short</i>. We should be strange to ourselves, and design that the
‘right hand should not know what the left hand doth,’ which must be
by having our eye upon the imperfections that attend us at the best.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>It must be our care to be suspicious of the working
of pride in us</i>; and also by an industrious watchfulness to give a stop
or check to thoughts of this nature when they arise.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>The conquest of this cannot be expected without a
serious and constant labour herein</i>. A humble soul is compared by
David to a weaned child, Ps. cxxxi. 2. But a child is not weaned
easily. Wormwood must be laid on the breast, and time allowed,
before the child will forget it. He only that is content to exercise a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
discipline upon himself, and by frequent practices to habituate himself
to low and careful thoughts, is likely to overcome it.</p>

<p>Pride, we have seen, was Satan’s great engine to bring on presumption.
The means by which he endeavoureth to beget pride, as
was before noted, were,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>The consideration of privileges</i>, as being ‘the Son of
God.’ For this expression, ‘If thou art the Son of God,’ is now urged
in a sense different from that which it had in the first temptation.
There he propounded it as unlikely that he should be the Son of God,
and yet be under such a disregard of providence. In this sense it
notably suited his design of drawing him to a distrust of God’s care,
and consequently of his sonship. Here he is upon a contrary temptation,
and therefore propounds this as a thing of which Christ was
assured, and from that assurance he thus disputes: ‘Thou believest
thou art the Son of God, and dost well depend on his care; therefore
needest thou not to distrust thy preservation, if thou castest thyself
down.’</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, To help his confidence forward to the undertaking,
he suggests <i>what credit and honour it would be to him, in the sight of
all the people, to be so miraculously kept from hurt</i>. Hence note,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 11. <i>That Satan doth usually kindle and nourish pride, by a
perverse confidence of our privileges.</i></p>

<p>It is very hard for Christians to carry their assurance <i>even</i>: not
but that grace in its proper working begets humility, and a watchful
care against sin and folly; but such is our infirmity that we are easily
drawn to be proud of our mercies, and to persuade ourselves that we
may make bold with God because we are his children. Hence was
that paradox of Mr Foxe, ‘That his sins did him most good, and his
graces most hurt;’ he means, sins occasioned his humility, whereas
his graces were apt, through his weakness, to make him proud. And
to hide this pride from man, God is forced to keep them sometime
from the sight of their assurance, or to discipline them by other
temptations, as he did with Paul, lest they should be ‘exalted above
measure.’</p>

<p>Note further, <i>Obs.</i> 12. <i>That popular applause Satan finds, and useth
accordingly, to be a great instigator to pride.</i></p>

<p>The great thing that moved the Pharisees in their often fastings
and large charity, was that they might have praise of men, and therefore
took they care to be seen of men.<a id="FNanchor_426_426" href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> The heathens noted this to
be the great feeder of that humour which animated them, as a drum
or trumpet animates soldiers to adventurous acts.<a id="FNanchor_427_427" href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> And some good
men have found no small difficulty to carry steadily, when they have
been hoisted up by the breath of men’s praise; which hath also occasioned
those serious cautions against the danger of flattery and high
commendations, ‘A flattering mouth worketh ruin,’ Prov. xxvi. 28.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVII_3">CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Satan’s subtlety in urging that of Ps. </i>xci. 11, 12, <i>to Christ.—Of his
imitating the Spirit of God in various ways of teaching.—Of his
pretending Scripture to further temptation.—The reasons of such
pretendings, and the ends to which he doth abuse it.—Of Satan’s
unfaithfulness in managing of scriptures.—Cautions against that
deceit.—The ways by which it may be discovered.</i></p>


<p>The ways of Satan, hitherto insisted on, to engage Christ in this act
of presumption, were secret insinuations and underhand contrivances:
but that which he openly and expressly urged to this purpose, was
an argument drawn from the promise of God, though sadly abused
and misrepresented, ‘He shall give his angels charge concerning thee,’
&amp;c. This we are next to consider, in which, as cited by him, we may
easily see, (1.) That Satan affected an imitation of Christ, in the way
of his resistance. Christ had urged Scripture before, and now Satan
endeavours to manage the same weapon against him. (2.) It is
observable that Scripture is the weapon that Satan doth desire to
wield against him. In his other ways of dealing he was shy, and did
but lay them in Christ’s way, offering only the occasion, and leaving
him to take them up; but in this he is more confident, and industriously
pleads it, as a thing which he could better stand to and more
confidently avouch. (3.) The care of his subtlety herein, lay in the
misrepresentation and abuse of it, as may be seen in these particulars:
[1.] In that he urged this promise to promote a sinful thing, contrary
to the general end of all Scripture, which was therefore written ‘that
we sin not.’ [2.] But more especially in his clipping and mutilating
of it. He industriously leaves out that part of it which doth limit
and confine the promise of protection to lawful undertakings, such as
this was not, and renders it as a general promise of absolute safety,
be the action what it will. It is a citation from Ps. xci. 11, 12,
which there runs thus, ‘He shall give his angels charge over thee, to
keep thee in all thy ways.’ These last words, ‘in all thy ways,’ which
doth direct to a true understanding of God’s intention in that promise,
he deceitfully leaves out, as if they were needless and unnecessary
parts of the promise, when indeed they were on purpose put there by
the Spirit of God, to give a description of those persons and actions,
unto whom, in such cases, the accomplishment of the promise might
be expected; for albeit the word in the original, which is translated
‘ways’— דרכים—doth signify any kind of way or action in the general,
yet in this place it doth not; for then God were engaged to an absolute
protection of men, not only when they unnecessarily thrust themselves
into dangers, but in the most abominably sinful actions whatsoever;
which would have been a direct contradiction to those many scriptures
wherein God threatens to withdraw his hand and leave sinners to
the danger of their iniquities; but it is evident that the sense of it is
no more than this, ‘God is with you, while you are with him.’ We
have a paraphrase of this text, to this purpose, in Prov. iii. 23, ‘Then
shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble:’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
where the condition of this safety, pointed to in the word ‘then,’ which
leads the promise, is expressly mentioned in the foregoing verses, ‘My
son, let them’—that is, the precepts of wisdom—‘not depart from thine
eyes.... Then’—not upon other terms—‘shalt thou walk in thy way
safely.’ The ways then in this promise, cited by Satan, are the ways
of duty, or the ways of our lawful callings. The fallacy of Satan in
this dealing with Scripture is obvious, and Christ might have given
this answer, as Bernard hath it, That God promiseth to keep him in
his ways, but not in self-created dangers, for that was not his way, but
his ruin; or if a way, it was Satan’s way, but not his.<a id="FNanchor_428_428" href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> (3.) To these
two, some add another abuse, in a subtle concealment of the following
verse in Ps. xci., ‘Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder.’ This
concerned Satan, whose cruelty and poisonous deceits were fitly represented
by the lion and the adder, and there the promise is also
explained to have a respect to Satan’s temptations—that is, God
would so manage his protection, that his children should not be led
into a snare.</p>

<p>Hence observe, <i>Obs.</i> 13. <i>That Satan sometimes imitates the Spirit of
God by an officious pretence of teaching the mind of God to men.</i></p>

<p>This our adversary doth not always appear in one shape. Sometime
he acts as a lion or dragon, in ways of cruelty and fierceness;
sometimes as a filthy swine, in temptations to bestial uncleanness and
sensual lusts; sometime he puts on the garb of holiness, and makes as
if he were not a spiritual adversary, but a spiritual friend and counsellor.
That this is frequent with him, the apostle tells us: 2 Cor. xi.
14, ‘Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.’ Angels of
light are those blessed spirits sent forth to minister for the good of the
elect, whose ministry God useth not only for our preservation from
bodily hurts, but also for prevention of sin and furtherance of duty.
Satan, as wicked as he is, doth counterfeit that employment, and takes
upon him to give advice for our good, pretending to teach us in the
truth, or to direct and further us in our endeavours.<a id="FNanchor_429_429" href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></p>

<p>That he designs an imitation of God and his Spirit, may be discovered
by expressing a great many particulars of God’s ways and
appointments, wherein Satan, as God’s ape, partly out of mockery and
scorn, partly upon other grounds of advantage to his intendments, doth
counterfeit the current coin of the Lord’s establishments by a very
close imitation. But I shall here confine myself to the point of teaching
and instruction, wherein how he proceeds, we shall the better
understand by considering how many ways God hath of old, and now
still doth use in declaring his mind to his people. The sum of all we
have, Heb. i. 12. Heretofore he signified his mind in ‘divers manners’
by the prophets, and ‘in these last days by his Son,’ in all which
we shall trace the steps of Satan.</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>God revealed himself sometime by voice</i>; as to Abraham,
Moses, and others. The devil hath dared to imitate this. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
want not instances of it; in the temptation, which is now under explanation,
he did so; and his confessing Christ, ‘I know thee who thou
art,’ [Mat. i. 24,] &amp;c., doth shew that he is ready enough to do it at any
time for advantage. Sprenger tells us a story of the devil’s preaching
to a congregation in the habit and likeness of a priest, wherein he reproved
sin, and urged truth, and seemed no way culpable for false
doctrine; but I suspect this for a fabulous tale. However, it is undeniable
that he sometime hath appeared to men with godly exhortations
in his mouth, of living justly, and doing no man wrong, &amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_430_430" href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a>
except we resolve to discredit all history, and the narrations of persons,
and some such are known to some in this auditory, who solemnly
affirm they have met with such dealing from him.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>God hath sometime revealed himself to men in ecstasies
and trances</i>; such as was that of Paul: Acts xxii. 17, ‘I was in an
ecstasy or trance,’ γενέσθαι με ἐν ἐκστάσει. This also hath the devil
imitated. Mohammed made this advantage of his disease, the epilepsy
or falling-sickness, pretending that at such times he was in an
ecstasy, and had converse with the angel Gabriel. But what he only
in knavery pretended, others have really felt. The stories of Familists
and deluded Quakers are full of such things. They frequently
have fallen down and have lain as in a swoon, and when they have
awaked, told wonderful stories of what they have heard and seen.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>Visions and dreams were usual things in the Old
Testament, and famous ways of divine revelation</i>; but Satan was not
behind in this matter. His instruments had their visions too. In
Ezek. xiii. 7 we have mention of vain visions and lying divinations;
and such satanical dreams are also noted, Deut. xiii. 1, ‘If there arise
among you a dreamer of dreams.’ Those days of confusion, that are
not yet out of memory, afforded store of these. While unstable,
giddy-headed people began to dote on novelties and questions in religion,
they gave opportunity to Satan to beguile them; for he taking
advantage of their nauseating of old truths, and their expectation of
sublime discoveries, which had sufficiently prepared them for any impression,
did so overwork their fancies that they easily conceited
themselves to have had divine revelations, and nothing was more ordinary
than to hear stories of visions and dreams. And this spread
further by a kind of infection, for it grew into a religious fashion; and
he was not esteemed that had not something of this nature to experience.
And though the folly and impertinences of such things
generally, and sometime the apparent wickedness of them, as contradicting
truth and the divine rules of holiness, were sufficient discoveries
that Satan’s hand was in them, yet until time, experience, and the
power of God had cooled the intemperate heat of this raving humour,
it continued in the good liking and admiration of the more inconsiderate
vulgar. And sometime those from whom more seriousness
and consideration might have been expected fell into a reverence for
these pretences in others, and helped forward this spiritual witchcraft
by their countenance and arguings, often abusing that text in Acts ii.
17, ‘Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream
dreams,’ by applying it to a justification of these apparently foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
dotages. And indeed the effect hath discovered they were no better,
for many of those things which with great confidence were avouched
as certain, were by time proved to be false. Many things were useless,
vain, ridiculous, and some were brought to lament and confess their
folly after they proceeded far in these ways; and at last, when the former
opportunities were worn out, Satan grew weary of that design as
being no longer proper to be insisted on. There is now a great calm,
so that it is but seldom that we hear of such things talked of. It
were needless to give particular instances, when you may at your
leisure fetch them from hundreds of pamphlets commonly known.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, One of the most noted ways by which God discovered
his mind was that of <i>inspiration</i>, by which some eminent persons,
called therefore prophets, spake the will of God ‘as they were moved
or acted by the Spirit of God,’ [2 Peter i. 21.] The devil had also his
false prophets. Such are frequently taxed in the Old Testament, and
foretold in the New: ‘False Christs, and false prophets shall arise,’
Mat. xxiv. 24; ‘There were false prophets among the people, as there
shall be false teachers among you,’ 2 Peter ii. 1. Many false teachers
are gone out into the world. Such a one was Montanus in Tertullian’s
time, David George, John of Leyden, Hacket, our countryman, were
such, and a great many such there have been in all ages. It is
notoriously known that Satan hath thus inspired poor, possessed
wretches, who have uttered threatenings against sin and woe to sinners.
The sayings of such possessed creatures have not long since
been gathered into a volume and published, as containing very persuasive
arguments to repentance and amendment of life.<a id="FNanchor_431_431" href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> Besides
these, our own times afford too many examples of this kind. Many
have put on the guise of the old prophets in a foolish though adventurous
imitation of their actions and prophecies. Some have in our
streets resembled Jonah in Nineveh, ‘Yet forty days,’ &amp;c. Some
fancied to walk naked like Isaiah; others have come with their
earthen pitchers and broken them, imitating these and other types by
which God in his true prophets foresignified his judgments to come;
in all which actions and garbs, with much earnestness, and in an
affected tone, they have called out for repentance in a confident denunciation
of woes and miseries, with a bold limiting of the time of
forty days, that the same might carry a parallel to Jonah’s prophecy,
and sometime giving—which is the surest way—an unlimited, uncertain
time. How the devil acts in these matters, and by what ways he
seduceth them to believe they are inspired of God, or have real visions
and revelations, it is not my business now to inquire; only let those
that think such things strange, consider that the devil hath the advantage
of deep fanciful apprehensions and a working melancholy in
such persons, by which he can easily work them to conceit anything,
and confidently believe what they have conceited.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, Sometime God notified his mind <i>by signs and
miracles</i>. Satan hath also his ‘lying signs and wonders;’ a power
God hath permitted him this way, which is very great, and the delusions
wrought thereby are strong, hazarding the deception of the
elect. This power of doing wonders the devil usually applies to false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
doctrines, to strengthen and countenance errors. The apostle testifies,
2 Thes. ii. 9, that Satan shall employ this power for the advancement
of the ‘man of sin, whose coming shall be with signs and
lying wonders.’ The beast arising out of the earth, Rev. xiii. 14, ‘he
shall deceive by the means of those miracles which he hath power to
do.’ And accordingly the popish legends are full of stories of miracles,
whereof, though most be lies, forgeries, and the false contrivements of
those who sought to bring the people to receive their doctrines, the
credit and advancement of which they sought by such ways; some
notwithstanding, though not true miracles, yet were truly acted, to
countenance those errors which are pretended to be established by
them.</p>

<p>(6.) Sixthly, God doth teach and lead his people <i>by impulses</i>.
Christ was thus ‘led of the Spirit into the wilderness;’ and Paul was
‘bound in spirit to go to Jerusalem,’ [Acts xx. 22.] It is common
for Satan to imitate such impulses. We have clear instances of
diabolical impulses to sin in Scripture. A strong impulse was on
Ananias, ‘Satan filled his heart,’ [Acts v. 3;] a strong impulse on
Judas, ‘Satan entered into his heart,’ [Luke xxii. 3;] and what then
more easy to apprehend, than that Satan can counterfeit better impulses,
and violently stir up the hearts of men to actions seemingly
good or indifferent? Some hypocrites are moved strongly to pray or
preach,—Satan therein aiming at an increase of pride or presumption
in them;—and they know no other, but that it is the Spirit of God.
God’s children may have impulses from Satan, upon pretences of zeal,
as the disciples had, when they called for fire from heaven. In these
impulses Satan doth not so act the heart of man as the Spirit of God
doth, whose commands in this case are irresistible; but he only works
by altering the disposition of our bodies in a natural way; and then
having fitted us all he can for an impression, he endeavours to set it
on by strong persuasions. Some memorable instances of these impulses
might profitably illustrate this. Math. Parisiensis takes notice
of a boy, in <i>anno</i> 1213, of whom also Fuller makes mention,<a id="FNanchor_432_432" href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> who,
after some loss which the Christians had received in the war against
the Turks, went up and down, singing this rhyme—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">‘Jesus Lord, redeem our loss:</div>
   <div class="verse">Restore to us thy holy cross.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And by this means he gathered a multitude of boys together, who
could not by the severest menaces of their parents be hindered from
following him to their own ruin. Another instance of a strange impulse
we have in Josephus:<a id="FNanchor_433_433" href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> one Jesus, the son of Ananus, about
four years before the destruction of Jerusalem, at the feast of tabernacles,
begins to cry out, ‘Woe, woe, to the east and west, to men
and women,’ &amp;c., and could by no means be restrained night or day;
and when his flesh was beaten off his bones, he begged no pity nor
ease, but still continued his usual crying.</p>

<p>(7.) Seventhly, God doth also by his Spirit teach his people in
<i>bringing things to their remembrance</i>, John xiv. 26. Satan also in
imitation of this, can put into the minds of men, with great readiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
and dexterity, promises or sentences of Scripture, insomuch that they
conclude that all such actings are from the Spirit of God, who, as
they conclude, set such a scripture upon their heart. Thus dealt
Satan with Christ. He urgeth the promise upon him, wherein upon
the matter he doth as much, as when he secretly suggests such things
to the heart without an audible voice. In this way of craft Satan
doth very much resemble the true work of the Spirit; [1.] In the
readiness and quickness of suggesting; [2.] In seeming exact-suiting
scripture suggested, with the present occasion; and [3.] In the
earnestness of his urging it upon the fancies of men. Yet when all
this is done, they that shall seriously consider all ends, matter and
circumstances, will easily observe it is but the cunning work of a
tempter, and not from the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 14. Observe also, <i>That whatever be the various ways of Satan’s
imitation, yet the matter which he works and practiseth upon is still
Scripture</i>. To this he confines himself:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>Because the Scriptures are generally, among Christians,
received as the undoubted oracles of God, the rule of our lives and
duties, and the grounds of our hope</i>. It would be a vain and bootless
labour to impose upon those that retain this belief, the sayings of the
Turkish Alcoran, the precepts of heathen philosophers, or any other
thing that may carry a visible estrangement from or contradiction to
Scripture. He could not then possibly pretend to a divine instruction,
nor could he so ‘transform himself into an angel of light:’ but
by using this covert of divine command, promise, or discovery, he can
more easily beget a belief that God hath said it, and that there is
neither sin nor danger in the thing propounded, but duty and advantage
to be expected; and this is the very thing that makes way for an
easy entertainment of such delusions. Poor creatures believe that is
all from God, and that they are acted by his Spirit, and that with such
confidence that they contemn and descry those, as ignorant of divine
mysteries, and of the power of God, who are not so besotted as themselves.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>The Scriptures have a glorious irresistible majesty in
them, peculiar to themselves, which cannot be found in all that art or
eloquence can contribute to other authors</i>. It is not play-book language,
nor scraps of romances that Satan can effect these cheats
withal; and therefore we may observe that in the highest delusions
men have had pretences of Scripture; and their strong persuasions of
extraordinary discoveries have stricken men into a reverence of their
profession, because of the Scripture words and phrases with which
their boldest follies are woven up. For let but men inquire into the
reason of the prevalency of Familism of old, upon so vast a number of
people as were carried away with it, and they shall find that the great
artifice lay in the words they used, a language abstracted from Scripture,
to signify such conceits as the Scripture never intended. Hence
were their expressions always high, soaring, and relating to a more
excellent and mystical interpretation of those divine writings. This
may be observed in David George, Hen. Nicholas, and others, who
usually talk of being consubstantiated with God, taken up into his
love, of the angelical life, and a great deal more of the same kind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
The Ranters at first had the like language, and the Quakers after
them affected such a canting expression. And we may be the more
certain of the truth of this observation, that such a kind of speaking,
which borrows its majesty from the style of the Scripture, is of moment
to Satan’s design; because we find the Scripture itself gives particular
notice of it. The false teachers in 2 Pet. ii. 18, are described, among
other things, by their ‘swelling words of vanity,’ which the Syriac
renders to be ‘a proud and lofty way of speaking.’ The original
signifies no less—ὑπέρογκα,—they were words swelled like bladders,
though being pricked, they be found to be empty sounds, and no substance.
There are indeed swelling words of atheistical contempt of
those who, as the psalmist speaks, ‘set their mouths against heaven,’
Ps. lxxiii. 9, 11; but this passage of Peter, as also the like in Jude
16, signify big swollen words, from high pretensions and fancies
of knowing the mind of God more perfectly; for they that use them
pretend themselves prophets of God, ver. 1, and as to their height in
profession, are compared to clouds highly soaring; and in 2 Cor. xi.
14, they are said to be ‘transformed into the apostles of Christ,’ and
to the garb of the ‘ministers of righteousness.’ And that which is
more, this particular design of Satan is noted as the rise of all; ‘No
marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.’</p>

<p>Having seen the reasons why Satan chooseth Scripture as his tool to
work by, I shall next shew to what base designs he makes it subserve.</p>

<p>[1.] First, He useth this artifice <i>to beget and propagate erroneous
doctrines</i>. Hence no opinion is so vile, but pretends to Scripture as
its patron. The Arians pretend Scripture against the divinity of
Christ. The Socinians, Pelagians, Papists, yea, and those that pretend
to inspirations for their rule, and disclaim the binding force of
those antiquated declarations of the saints’ conditions, as they call
them, yet conform all their sayings to the Scripture expression, and
endeavour to prove their mistakes by its authority.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>He makes abused Scripture to encourage sinful
actions</i>. He can cite passages of God’s patience and long-suffering, of
his pardoning grace and readiness to forgive, and a thousand more,
upon no other design than the ‘turning of the grace of God into wantonness,’
[Jude 4.] When professors turn loose and negligent, when they
adventure too far upon sinful pleasures, they lick themselves whole by
an overforward grasping at such passages of Scripture, which Satan
will with great readiness set upon their hearts; and then they pretend
to themselves that their peace is made up with God, and that they
have no less than a sealed pardon in their bosoms; which notwithstanding
may be known to have only Satan’s hand and seal at it, by
their overly and formal sorrow for such miscarriages, and their readiness
to return to the same follies again.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, By this imitation of the commands and promises of
God, <i>he doth strangely engage such as he can thus delude unto desperate
undertakings</i>.<a id="FNanchor_434_434" href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> The Familists of Germany were persuaded by this
delusion, to expose themselves unarmed to the greatest hazards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
upon vain pretences of promises set home upon them, as that God
would fight for them, that they must ‘stand still and see the salvation
of God,’ [Exod. xiv. 13.] Some of later times have paid their lives
for their bold misapplication of that promise, ‘One shall chase a
thousand,’ [Deut. xxxii. 30.] Judas of Galilee and Theudas were
prompted by Satan to gather multitudes together, though to their own
ruin, upon a vain persuasion that they were raised up of God, and
that God would be with them.<a id="FNanchor_435_435" href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, He sometimes <i>procures groundless peace and assurance
in the hearts of careless ones by Scripture misapplied</i>. Many you
may meet with who will roundly tell you a long story how they were
cast down and comforted by such a scripture brought to their minds,
when, it may be much feared, they are but deceived, and that as yet
God hath not spoken peace to them.</p>

<p>Lastly, This way of Satan’s setting home scriptures proves sadly
effectual to beget or heighten <i>the inward distresses and fears of the
children of God</i>. It is a wonder to hear some dispute against themselves,
so nimble they be to object a scripture against their peace,
above their reading or ability, that you would easily conclude there is
one at hand that prompts them, and suggests these things to their
own prejudice. And sometime a scripture will be set so cross or
edgeway to their good and comfort, that many pleadings, much time,
prayers, and discourses cannot remove it. I have known some that
have seriously professed scriptures have been thrown into their hearts
like arrows, and have with such violence fixed a false apprehension
upon their minds, as that God had cut them off, that they were reprobate,
damned, &amp;c., that they have borne the tedious, restless affrightments
of it for many days, and yet the thing itself, as well as the
issue of it, doth declare that this was not the fruit of the Spirit of
God, which is a spirit of truth, and cannot suggest a falsehood, but
of Satan, who hath been a liar from the beginning.</p>

<p>Observe lastly, <i>Obs.</i> 15. <i>Though Satan useth Scripture in these deceitful
workings, yet he never doth it faithfully.</i></p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>Because it is against his nature, as it is now corrupted
by his fall</i>. There is no truth in him: ‘When he speaketh a lie he
speaketh of his own, for he is a liar,’ John viii. 44; not that he
cannot speak a truth, but that he usually is a liar, and that he never
speaks truth but with a purpose to deceive.<a id="FNanchor_436_436" href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>To deal faithfully in urging scriptures upon the
consciences of men, is also contrary to his interest</i>. He hath a kingdom
which he endeavours to uphold. This kingdom, being directly
contrary to that of Christ’s, which is a kingdom of light, is therefore
called a kingdom of darkness, being maintained and propagated only
by lies and deceits. He cannot then be supposed to use Scripture
faithfully, because that is the true sceptre of Christ’s kingdom, for
then should Satan, as Christ argues, Mat. xii. 26, ‘cast out Satan,
and be divided against himself.’</p>

<p>This unfaithful dealing with Scripture is threefold.</p>

<p>(1.) First, The unfaithfulness of his <i>design</i>. Though he speaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
what is true, yet he doth it with an evil mind, aiming at one of these
three things:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>To deceive and delude</i>. If he applies promises, or insists
upon the privileges of God’s children, it is to make them proud or
presumptuous. If he urge threatenings, or stir up the conscience to
accuse for sin, it is to bring them to despair; if he object the law, it
is to enrage lust; and that ‘sin by the commandment might become
exceeding sinful,’ [Rom. vii. 13.]</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, His design is sometime <i>to bring the Scripture under
suspicion or contempt</i>. He puts some weak Christians upon unseasonable
or imprudent use of Scripture, and then tempts others to laugh
at them, and to despise in their hearts those ways of religion which
some zealots with too much weakness do manage. Men are apt
enough to scoff at the most serious and weighty duties of holiness,
even when performed in a most serious manner. If David put on
sackcloth, and afflict himself with fasting, it is presently turned to his
reproach, ‘and the drunkards make a song of it,’ [Ps. lxix. 12;] but
much more advantage hath the devil to raise up scorn and loathing in
the minds of debauched persons, by the affected and unskilful use of
Scripture. Some by a narrow confinement of the words <i>brother</i> and
<i>sister</i> to those of their own fellowship, as if none else were to be
owned by them, have occasioned the scoff of holy brethren—a phrase
notwithstanding used with a grave seriousness by the apostle—in the
usual discourses of those who wait all occasions to harden themselves
against the power of religion. The like observations they make of
other ways and forms of speaking, which some have accustomed themselves
unto, in a conscientious conformity to Scripture phrase: in all
which the devil observing the weakness and injudiciousness of some
on the one hand, and the scornful pride of others on the other hand,
is willing to provide matter for their atheistical jeers, by putting all
the obligations he can upon the consciences of the weak, to continue
in the use of these expressions. For some proof of this matter we
may note the secret deceit of Satan, in that liberal profession of Christ
to be ‘the Son of God,’ [Mark i. 24; Luke iv. 34], ‘I know thee who
thou art; the Holy One of God.’ Here was truth spoken by him, and
one would have thought with great ingenuity;<a id="FNanchor_437_437" href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> but yet he cunningly
insinuated into the minds of the hearers a ground of suspicion that he
was not the Son of God; and for that end calls him Jesus of Nazareth,
as if Christ had been born there. He knew well that the Jews
expected no Messiah from Nazareth, and therefore on set purpose
used he that expression, that he might draw him into contempt. And
accordingly we find this very mistake, that Christ was born at
Nazareth, became an argument against him: John vii. 41, while some
were convinced, and said, ‘This is the Christ,’ others said, ‘Shall
Christ come out of Galilee?’</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Another part of his design in the use of scriptures is
to <i>put a varnish upon hypocrisy</i>. He is ready to serve men by putting
Scripture expressions in their mouths, and inuring them to a constant
use of the phrases of those divine writings, that they may less
suspect themselves of the pride, formality, and secret wickedness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
their hearts; and to help on their mistakes concerning their spiritual
condition, he can urge upon their consciences those scriptures that
serve to engage them in external observances of religion. It may
appear by the Pharisee’s boast of fasting ‘twice a week,’ of ‘paying
tithes,’ of ‘giving alms,’ Luke xviii. 11, that their consciences were
someway concerned in these things, so that though they were left
without check of conscience ‘to devour widows’ houses,’ yet were they
urged to make ‘long prayers.’ Suitable to this is that which Solomon
speaks of the harlot, who, to colour over her wickedness, had her offerings
and vows; and when her conscience is appeased with these performances,
she can excuse herself in her way of sinning, ‘She eats
and wipes her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness,’ Prov.
xxx. 20. Satan doth but hereby help to paint a sepulchre, or gild
a potsherd, and to furnish men with excuses and pretexts in their
way of sinning. Not unlike to this was that service which the devil
with great readiness performed—as I was informed from some of good
credit—to a young student who had fallen upon some books of magic
in a college library, into which having stolen privately one night in
pursuit of that study, was almost surprised by the president, who,
seeing a candle there at an unseasonable time, suddenly opens the
door to know who was up so late, in which strait the devil—to gratify
his pupil with a ready excuse—snatcheth away his book, and in a
moment lays Montanus his Bible before him, that he might pretend
that for his employment.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Another point of Satan’s unfaithful dealing with
Scripture is <i>his false citation of it</i>. It is nothing with him to alter,
change, or leave out such a part as may make against him. If he
urge promises upon men, in order to their security and negligence, he
conceals the condition of them, and banisheth the threatening far
from their minds, representing the mercy of God in a false glass, as
if he had promised to save and bring to heaven every man upon the
common and easy terms of being called a Christian. If it be his
purpose to disquiet the hearts of God’s children, to promote their
fears, or to lead them to despair, then he sets home the commands
and threatenings, but hides the promises that might relieve them,
and, which is remarkable, he hath so puzzled some by setting on their
hearts a piece of Scripture, that when the next words, or next verse,
might have eased them of their fears, and answered the sad objections
which they raised against themselves from thence, as if their
eyes had been holden, or as if a mist had been cast over them, they
have not for a long time been able to consider the relief which they
might have had. This hiding of Scripture from their eyes, setting
aside what God may do for the just chastisement of his children’s
folly, is effected by the strong impression which Satan sets upon
their hearts, and by holding their minds down to a fixed meditation
of the dreadful inferences which he presents to them from thence,
not suffering them to divert their thoughts by his incessant clamours
against them.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, He unfaithfully handleth scriptures, <i>by wresting the
true import and sense of them</i>. We read of some, 2 Pet. iii. 16, who
‘wrest the Scripture.’ The word in the original—στρεβλοῦσι—signifies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
a racking or torturing of it, as men upon a rack are stretched beyond
their due length, to a dislocation of their joints, and sometimes forced
to speak what they never did nor intended; so are the Scriptures
used. Those that do so are Satan’s scholars, and taught of him,
though in regard of the Spirit’s true teaching, they are called unlearned,
which is sufficient to shew Satan’s deceitful dealing. He
often lays his dead and corrupt sense—as the harlot did with her
dead child in the room of the living infant—in the place of the living
meaning of the scripture. This may be seen evidently:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>In heresies or errors</i>. These are Satan’s brood, and
there are none so vile, that pretend to Christian religion, but they
claim a kindred to Scripture, and are confident on its authority for
them. Now seeing truth is but one, and these errors not only contradictory
to truth, but to each other, Satan could never spin out such
conclusions from the divine oracles, but by wresting them from their
true intendments; and he that would contemplate the great subtlety
of Satan in this his art, need but consider what different strange and
monstrous shapes are put upon the Scripture by the several heresies
which march under its colours. The Quakers in their way represent
it like an old almanack out of date, and withal, in the use they make
of it, they render it as a piece of nonsensical furious raving. The
Socinians take down the sublime mysteries of Christ’s satisfaction and
justification by faith, with external rewards and punishments, to a
strain as low as the Turkish Alcoran. The papists make it like a
few leaves of an imperfect book, wanting beginning and end, and so
not fit to be set up as a sufficient rule. The Ranters make it seem
rather like language from hell than the commands of the pure and
holy God. Some will have it to countenance most ridiculous inventions
in worship; others will have it to discharge all outward observations
and ordinances, as childish rudiments. Some raise it all to the
pitch of enigmatical unintelligible mysteries; others can find no more
in the precepts of it than in Aristotle’s ethics. Thus by distorting
and wresting, Satan hath learned these unskilful ones to make it serve
their vilest lusts and humours.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, The same art of wresting Scripture is observable in
his <i>secret suggestings</i>. If he would encourage any in sin, he can
wrest Scripture for that, and tell him that God is merciful, that Christ
died for sinners, that there is hope of pardon, that saints have done
the like: things very true in themselves, but perverted by him to another
sense than ever they were intended to by God, who hath spoken
these things that we sin not. If he would discourage a saint, he can
tell him when he finds him doubting his estate, that the ‘fearful and
unbelieving have their part in the lake which burns with fire and
brimstone,’ Rev. xxi. 8; when he finds him under a known sin, he
tells that of the apostle, ‘If we sin wilfully after we have received the
knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,’
[Heb. x. 26.] When he observes them discomposed and wandering
in duty, then he objects, ‘They draw nigh me with their lips, but
their heart is far from me,’ [Isa. xxix. 13.] If he sees them dull and
without consolation at the Lord’s supper, then to be sure they hear of
him, ‘He that eats and drinks unworthily, eateth and drinketh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
damnation to himself,’ 1 Cor. xi. 29. If he find him bemoaning that he is
not so apprehensive of mercies or judgments as he would be, then he
sets home some such scripture as this, ‘This people’s heart is waxed
gross, and their ears are dull of hearing,’ Mat. xiii. 15, &amp;c. These
scriptures are frequently perverted by Satan from the true and proper
meaning of them. I have had complaints from several dejected
Christians of these very scriptures urged upon them to their great
trouble, when yet it was evident that none of these were truly applied,
by Satan’s temptation against them.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> These things give us warning not <i>to take anything of this
nature upon trust</i>. If Satan can so imitate the Spirit of God in applications
of Scripture, and bringing it to our remembrance, we have
great reason to beware lest we be imposed upon by Satan’s design
clothed in Scripture phrase; not that I would have men esteem the
secret setting of Scripture upon their minds, to be in all cases a delusion,
and to be disregarded as such. Some indeed there are that
so severely remark the weaknesses of professors of religion, that they
raise up a scorn to that which is of most necessary and serious use.
Because the devil prevails with some hypocrites to gild themselves
with Scripture phrase, and others through imprudent inadvertency are,
unknown to themselves, beguiled by Satan, to misapplications of Scripture
to their own estate, or to other things; they therefore decry all
the inward workings of the heart, as fancy or affected singularity;
these do but the devil’s work. But that the Spirit of God, whom Satan
treacherously endeavours to imitate, doth set home Scripture commands,
threatenings, and promises upon the hearts of his people, is
not only attested by the experience of all that are inwardly acquainted
with the ways of God, but is one of the great promises which Christ
hath given for the comfort of his people in his absence: John xiv. 26,
‘But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father shall
send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things
to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.’ This then
being granted as a firm unshaken truth, our care must be in discovering
and avoiding Satan’s counterfeit using of Scripture, and in this
we should be more wary;</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>Because we are not so apt to suspect what we meet with
in such a way, when it is brought to us in the language of Scripture</i>.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>And those that are not exercised in the Scripture, will
be at a sad loss, as not knowing how to extricate themselves from such
difficulties as may arise to them from Satan’s sophistry</i>.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Wariness is also more necessary, <i>because we are inclinable
to believe what suits our desires, and conscience awakened is
averse to the rejecting of that which answers its fears</i>.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> You may say, What is there of direction for us in this case?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> The answer is ready. Two things are given us in charge.
(1.) That we be wisely suspicious. A facile hasty credulity is treacherous.
Christ forbids, when he foretells the rising of false Christs,
Mat. xxiv. 26, the forwardness of a sudden belief, taxing thereby those
that are presently taken with every new appearance. It is childish
to be carried with every wind. We are warned also of this: 1 John
iv. 1, ‘Believe not every spirit.’ (2.) We are commanded to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
all pretences whatsoever to trial. Though immediate revelation or
vision be pretended, or extraordinary commission, yet must all be
brought to the touchstone. ‘We must prove all things,’ 1 Thes. v.
21, ‘and try those that say they are apostles,’ Rev. ii. 2; nay, ‘the
spirits are to be tried whether they be of God,’ 1 John iv. 1.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> You will say, How must we try?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> I answer, God hath given a public, sufficient, and certain rule,
which is <i>the Scripture, and all must be tried by that</i>; so that if there
be impulses or discoveries or remembrances of Scripture upon any, it
must not be taken for granted that they are of God, because they pretend
so high, for so we shall make Satan judge in his own cause; but
lay all to the line and plummet of the written word, and if it answer
not that, call it confidently a delusion, and reject it as accursed, though
it might seem in other regards to have been suggested by an angel
from heaven.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> But it will be said, Satan pretends to this rule, and it is Scripture
that is urged by him.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> I answer, Though it be so, yet he useth not Scripture in its own
intendment and sense. For the discovery of his unfaithful dealing;—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>Compare the inference of the suggestion with other scriptures</i>.
If it be from a dark scripture, compare it with those that are
more plain, and in every case see whether the general current of the
Scriptures speak the same thing; for if it be from Satan, he either plays
with the words and phrases, from doubtful and equivalent terms
making his conclusion, or his citation will be found impertinent, or,
which is most usual, contrary to truth or holiness. If any of these
appear by a true examination of the import of the scripture which he
seeks to abuse, or by comparing it with the scope and genius of other
scriptures, you may certainly pronounce that it is not of God, but
Satan’s deceit.<a id="FNanchor_438_438" href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>Consider the tendency of such suggestions</i>. Let no
man say that this will come too late, or that it is an after-game. I
do not mean that we should stay so long as to see the effects, though
this is also a certain discovery of Satan’s knavery in his highest pretences.
The fanatic furies of the German enthusiasts do now appear
plain to all the world to have been delusions, by their end, fruits, and
issue. But that while these conclusions are obtruded upon us, we
should observe to what they tend, which we shall the better know if
all circumstances round about be considered. Sometimes Satan doth
covertly hint his mind, and send it along with the suggestions; sometimes
our condition will enough declare it, and there is no case but it
will afford something of discovery if seriously pondered. If he either
prompt us to pride, vainglory, or presumption, or that our condition
sway us that way, it will be sufficient ground of suspicion that it is
Satan that then urgeth promises or privileges upon us. If we are of
a wounded spirit, inclined to distrust, or if we be put on to despair, it
is past denial that it is Satan that urgeth the threatenings, and presseth
the accusations of the law against us. He that gathers stones, timber,
lime, and such materials together, as are usually employed in building,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
doth discover his intention before he actually build his house, and thus
may Satan’s end be known by his preparations, compared with the
sway and inclination of our present temper.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>It must be remembered that with these endeavours, we
often seek the face of the Lord for help and counsel</i>; and that we apply
ourselves to such of the servants of God, as being more knowing than
ourselves, and less prepossessed in their judgments, because not concerned,
are better able to see into the nature of our straits, and to help
us by their advices.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVIII_3">CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and
sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.</i>—<span class="smcap">Mat.</span>
iv. 8.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The manner of Satan’s shewing the kingdoms of the world.—Of Satan’s
preparations before the motion of sin.—Of his confronting the
Almighty by presumptuous imitation, and in what cases he doth so.—Of
his beautifying the object of a temptation, and how he doth it.—His
way of engaging the affections by the senses.—Of his seeming
shyness.</i></p>


<p>This is the preparation to the third temptation; in which we have,
(1.) The place where it was acted; (2.) The object set before him
there.</p>

<p>1. First, The place was an ‘exceeding high mountain.’ What
mountain it was, Nebo, Pisgah, or any other, it is needless to inquire.
It is of more use to ask after the reasons of Satan’s choice of such a
place. The text doth clearly imply one; that was the commodiousness
of prospect. Satan intending to give him a view of the kingdoms of
the world, chooseth a mountain as fittest for that end. But that this
was not all the reason, is not only intimated by some,<a id="FNanchor_439_439" href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> but positively
affirmed by others,<a id="FNanchor_440_440" href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> who think that Satan in this imitated the like in
God to Moses, who was called up to Mount Nebo to view the land
which God promised to Israel. Whether these circumstances of the
mountain, and the view of the kingdoms of the world, were of purpose
contrived to affront God by such an imitation, I will not be positive
in it; but we may with greater evidence affirm that in offering the
kingdoms of the world as things altogether in his disposal, he doth
directly outbrave God by an insolent comparison of his power with
that of the Almighty’s, whose is ‘the earth and the fulness of it,’ [Ps.
xxiv. 1,] and to whom the sovereignty of the disposal of it doth
belong.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, That which Satan sheweth Christ from the mountain
is said to be ‘the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.’
Here some busy themselves to conjecture what kingdoms were thus
pointed at. Some keep so strictly to the word ‘all,’ that they are
forced to take up with that opinion, that all these temptations were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
only in vision,<a id="FNanchor_441_441" href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> for they consider that no one mountain in the world
can give a prospect over one whole hemisphere, or if it could, yet no
eye would be able to discern at so great a distance. But the inconveniences
of this surmise have been pointed at before, and it is enough
to shew that the text may admit of an interpretation which shall not
be encumbered with this supposed impossibility.</p>

<p>Others restrain this to the land of Canaan, as if Satan only shewed
this as a famous instance of the glory of all kingdoms. Some think
the Roman empire, which was then most flourishing, and lifted up its
head above other kingdoms, was the great bait laid before Christ, as
if he had a design to divert Christ from the business of his office, by
offering him the seat and power of Antichrist.<a id="FNanchor_442_442" href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> But the text runs
not so favourably for any of these opinions as to constrain us to stay
upon them. ‘Kingdoms of the world’ seem to intend more than
Canaan or the Roman empire; the word κόσμος used here, and
οἰκουμένη in Luke, which we translate ‘the world,’ do so apply to one
another in a mutual accommodation, that we cannot stretch the ‘world’
to the largest sense of the whole globe of the earth, because it is expressed
in Luke by οἰκουμένη, which signifies such a part of the world
which is more cultivated and honoured by inhabitants; nor can we so
restrain it to the Roman empire-though when they spake their apprehensions
of their own empire, they seem to engross all, Luke ii. 1—because
Matthew useth the word κόσμος, a word of greater freedom.
It seems then that many kingdoms, or the most considerable kingdoms
of the then known world, were here exposed to his sight. But then
the difficulty still remains, how the devil could shew them to his eye.
That it was not a visionary discovery to his mind, hath been said.
Some think he shewed these partly by ocular prospect of those cities,
castles, towns, vineyards, and fields that were near, as a compend of
the whole, and partly by a discourse of the glory, power, and extent
of other kingdoms that were out of the reach of the eye; but because
the expression which Luke adds, ‘in a moment of time’—ἐν στυγμῇ
χρόνου—intimates, that the way which Satan took was different from
common prospecting or beholding, others are not satisfied with that
solution of the difficulty, but fly to this supposition, that Satan used
only juggling and delusion, by framing an airy horizon before the eyes
of Christ, shewing not the kingdoms themselves, but a phantasm of
his own making. But seeing this might have been done in any place,
and that a high mountain was chosen for furthering the prospect, I
think it is safest to conclude that the prospect was ocular, and not
fantastical but real, only helped and assisted by Satan’s skill and art,
as a great naturalist and as a prince of the power of the air, by which
means, in reflections or extraordinary prospectives, he might discover
things at vast distances; which we may the rather fix upon, because
we know what helps for prospect art hath discovered by glasses and
telescopes, by which the bodies of the sun, moon, and planets, at such
unspeakable distance from us, have in this latter age been discovered
to us beyond ordinary belief.<a id="FNanchor_443_443" href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> And we have reason to think that
Satan’s skill this way far exceeds anything that we have come to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
knowledge of, and so might make real discoveries of countries far remote,
more than we can well imagine.</p>

<p>These things thus explained, I shall note several observations.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 1. First, If we consider this great preparation that Satan makes
as introductory to the temptation to follow, we may observe, <i>that where
Satan hath a special design, he projects and makes ready all things
relating to the temptation before he plainly utter his mind</i>. He provides
his materials before he builds, and lays his train before he gives
fire. What is his method we may learn from the practice of those
that are trained up in his service. They, in Rom. xiii. 14, are said
to ‘make provision for the flesh’—πρόνοια—to fore-contrive their sins,
and to project all circumstances of time, place, occasion, and advantage
for their accomplishment. This is not to be understood of all
sins, for in some that are inward in the mind, as vain thoughts, pride
of heart, &amp;c., there needs not such provisions. We may say of them
their times are always, and in many cases ‘the house is swept and
garnished’ [Mat. xii. 44] to his hand; he finds all things ready by
the forwardness of those who are free in his service, and the sudden
accidental concurrence of things. But where the temptation is solemn,
and where the thing designed, in the perfecting of it, relates to exterior
acts, there he useth this policy, to have all in readiness, though it cost
him the labour of ‘compassing sea and land’ for it, before he expressly
speak his purposes. His reasons are these:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, If things necessary for the encouragement and accomplishment
of a temptation <i>lay out of the way, and were not at hand,
his suggestions would perish as soon as they were born, and would be
rejected as impossible or inconvenient</i>. To tempt a man to steal when
he knows not where nor how, or to revenge when he hath no enemy
nor provocation, seem to be no other than if they should be commanded
to remove a mountain or to fly in the air, which would quickly be declined
as motions affording no ground of entertainment. And therefore
that his temptations may not bring a reason of refusal with them
as being unseasonable, he takes care to fit his servants with all things
requisite for the work he puts them upon.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, As temptations of this kind would be no temptations,
because not feasible, <i>without their preparations, so must we not think
that it is the bare suggestion of Satan that makes a temptation to pierce</i>.
The reason of its prevalency is not barely because Satan breaks such a
motion to us, but because such a motion comes accomplished with all
suitable preparations. When it prevails, it is the sinful motion that
wounds; but preparations are as the feathers that wing his arrows,
without which they would neither fly nor pierce.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> Let this, (1.) First, <i>Renew our caution and suspicion in
everything and every place that Satan is at work against us, though
we see no visible snare</i>.</p>

<p>Let it put us upon such a watchful carefulness in every of our ways,
that we may resolve to undertake nothing for which we have not a
good and warrantable reason at hand, that if our conscience say to us,
What dost thou here? we may be able to give a good account.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, If we mind the behaviour of Satan in these preparations
and offers, <i>we see him act after the pattern of highest sovereignty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
disposing of earthly kingdoms at such a rate as if all power were in
his hand</i>. Hence we may observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 2. <i>That when Satan tempts to sin of highest contempt and
insolency against God, he then thinks it concerns him to bear himself
out by confronting the Almighty in imitating his authority and
power.</i></p>

<p>This carriage of Satan is not to be found in all his temptations.
For in most cases he acts with greatest secrecy; and as a thief that is
afraid of discovery, he useth all ways possible for concealment; but
when he sets up himself as ‘the god of the world,’ and stands in competition
with the Lord, claiming an interest in the fear and devotion
of men, then he boldly avoucheth himself, and labours to outvie God
in point of greatness, that he might possess them with a belief that he
only ought to be feared. This arrogancy of Satan against God may
be seen in three things:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>In imitating divine ordinances and institutions</i>. There
is not any part of divine worship, the observation whereof God hath
enjoined to men, but Satan hath set up something like it for himself.
As God appointed his temple, priests, altars, sacrifices, offerings, tithes,
sanctuaries, sacraments, &amp;c., so hath Satan had his temples, priests,
altars, sacrifices, offerings, sanctuaries, sacraments, &amp;c. This is sufficiently
known to any that read his histories; and I could give a full
account of it from heathen authors, but that I have done already when
I spoke of Satan’s subtlety in promoting idolatry in the world. I shall
only add here that which Varro relates<a id="FNanchor_444_444" href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> of the books of Numa Pompilius,
which were casually cast up by the plough of one Terentius
coming too near the sepulchre of Numa, where these books had been
buried. This Numa was the second king of the Romans, who instituted
the rites and ceremonies of pagan worship for his subjects,
and in these books, which he thought fit to conceal by burying them
with him, he had laid open the bottom of these devilish mysteries, so
that when they were brought to the senate, they, judging them unfit
to be known, adjudged them to the fire; which is a clear ground of
suspicion that he had there discovered so much of the causes of these
rites, or of the way whereby he came to be instructed in them, that
the public knowledge thereof consisted not with the interest of their
heathenish religion. This conjecture Austin hath of the matter,<a id="FNanchor_445_445" href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> who
also notes that Numa pretended familiar converse with the nymph
Ægeria as a plausible cover to that devilish art of <i>Hydromantia</i>, by
which he was instructed in ordering the ceremonies of idolatry which
he established.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Satan, with no less arrogancy, takes upon him to
imitate God <i>in his acts of power for the countenancing of his worship
in the world</i>. He had his miracles frequently, of which I have spoken
elsewhere; so had he his oracles, as at Delphos and other places.
Here it shall suffice to note that, as the sending the Lord Jesus into
the world, furnished with such power of doing miracles for the confirmation
of that office and authority which he had received from
God for the redemption of man, was the highest instance that can be
given of the mighty power, wisdom, and goodness of God; so Satan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
set himself with greatest industry to imitate that. Christ was almost
no sooner ascended to the Father, but we hear of Simon Magus, Acts
viii. 9, who was cried up as an instance of ‘the great power of God;’
and after that at Rome he gave out that he was God, confirming the
people in such a belief, by the strange things which he there did
among them, that a statue was erected for his honour, with this
inscription, ‘To Simon, a great god.’<a id="FNanchor_446_446" href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> Long after this the devil
raised up Apollonius Tyanæus, a man of an abstemious and commendable
life. Him the devil did design to match Christ in his miracles,
which were so many and so strange, that Philostratus doth not only
compare him to Christ, but prefer him as the more honourable person.
Christ himself foretold this stratagem of Satan, that he should raise
up ‘false Christs’ with ‘lying signs and wonders.’ And to omit
instances of former days, it is not beyond the memory of most of you,
that the devil renewed this policy in James Nayler, who, in a blasphemous
imitation of Christ’s riding to Jerusalem, rode to Bristol with
a great company before him, crying, ‘Holy, holy,’ and ‘Hosanna
to the son of David,’ and strewing the way with branches of trees. The
authority that was then, taking notice of this and other blasphemous
outrages, sentenced him to exemplary punishment; but here also the
devil renewed his mockery, for a certain citizen of London of good
note, being overcome with delusion, printed a book of Nayler’s sufferings,
wherein the devil had opportunity to vent his malice more fully,
for he compared all the parts of his punishment to the sufferings of
Christ; his whipping, he said, was that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by Matthew, ‘And Pilate delivered him to be scourged;’ his
stigmatizing, he said, was that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
by the prophet, ‘His visage was marred more than any man’s;’ the
boring of his tongue with a hot iron, he said, was the fulfilling of that,
and they ‘crucified him;’ and after other particulars of comparison,
in all which he equalled him to Christ, he at last takes notice that the
multitude of spectators held off their hats while his tongue was
bored through, a thing common in a crowd to give opportunity of
sight to those that are behind, and to this act he applies that of the
evangelists, ‘The vail of the temple was rent from the top to the
bottom.’</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>In acts of empire and sovereignty he imitates God</i>,
that is, as God propounds himself as the only Lord God, and enjoins
himself to be worshipped accordingly by promises of advantage in
case of obedience, and threatenings of miseries and plagues in case
of disobedience; so doth Satan set up himself in the world as god to
be adored and worshipped, and him do all idolaters worship, as God
testifies: Deut. xxxii. 17, ‘They sacrificed unto devils, not to God:’
Ps. cvi. 37, ‘They sacrificed their sons and daughters unto devils:’ 1
Cor. x. 20, ‘The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice
to devils, and not to God.’ And though it be true that many of these
blind worshippers did not formally worship the devil, but thought
they had worshipped God, yet by such cunning did he engage them
to take up with ways of worship of his prescribing, that it was in reality
a service done to him. But, besides this, in those places of the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
where he hath greater power, he formally propounds himself to be
worshipped, and doth accordingly often appear to them in a visible
shape; so that many of these blind heathens acknowledge two gods,
one good and another cruel and hurtful, which latter they say they
must worship, lest he destroy or harm them. By this Satan contests
with God for an empire in the world; and to promote it the more
he sometimes deals by fair promises of riches, advancement, pleasure,
and such other baits, to allure men to his professed service. Thus
are witches drawn to a compact with him. Thus Sylvester the Second
gave up himself to the devil for the popedom, and so did several
others. When this is not enough to prevail, he adds menacings, and
breathes forth cruel threatenings, by which means many heathens are
kept in awe by him and worship him, <i>ne noceat</i>, for no other reason
but to preserve themselves from hurt by him. In this temptation he
propounds himself to Christ as the object of divine worship, and boasts
of the kingdoms of the world as things of his disposal; by which he
seeks to draw him to fall down before him.</p>

<p>This course Satan takes for these reasons:—</p>

<p>First, <i>As this proud and malicious ostentation of his power is some
kind of satisfaction to his revengeful humour against God</i>; so, Secondly,
<i>He doth hereby raise up himself and his wicked institutions of idolatry
into credit and esteem with men</i>. Thirdly, <i>As this is a mockery to true
religion, and a scorn cast upon the ways of God’s service, to bring it
into disgrace and discredit</i>; so, Fourthly, <i>By this means he hardens
the hearts of men against God</i>. This was the consideration by which
Pharaoh hardened his heart. When Moses turned his rod into a
serpent, changed waters to blood, and did so many signs before him,
his magicians did the like; upon which the king might thus reason
with himself, that Moses had no other power but what his magicians
had, though he might think him a more skilful magician; and therefore
there was no reason to believe his message as being from God,
seeing his miracles might be no other than the effect of his art to
countenance a pretended command from heaven.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This insolency of Satan may inform us, First, <i>Of the great
patience of God</i>, that sees these outrageous mockings, and yet doth not
by a strong hand put a stop to them. Secondly, <i>Of the great power
and pride of Satan</i>, that he both can—though not without permission
from God—and dare attempt things of this nature. Thirdly, <i>The
great power of delusion</i>, that can so blind men, that they not only are
drawn to act a part in such designs, but believe confidently a divine
impulse and heavenly warrant for their so doing. Fourthly, <i>The
miserable slavery of such vassals of Satan</i> that are thus led by him,
who are therefore sadly to be pitied and lamented, as being under
such strong chains of captivity.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 3. Thirdly, <i>We cannot pass by the art which the devil here
useth to set off the temptation, and to make it plausible</i>. He sets
before him the world in all its glory. Here observe, <i>That Satan, in
his temptations to worldly pleasures, doth usually paint the object with
all its utmost beauty</i>.</p>

<p>When I have sometime observed a mountebank upon a stage, giving
excessive commendations of a trivial medicine, asserting it good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
almost for every disease, and with a great many lies and boastings
enforcing it upon the credulous multitude, it hath put me in mind of
this spiritual mountebankery of the devil. How doth he gull and
delude the foolish by laying out the pleasures of sin! and no otherwise
doth he keep them at a gazing admiration of worldly pomp,
delights, and satisfaction, which he promiseth them from iniquity,
than the serpent Scytale doth with passengers, whom she stays, by
amazing them with her beautiful colours, till she have stung them.<a id="FNanchor_447_447" href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a>
The art of Satan in this matter lies in four things:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>If there be anything that can be called a delight, or may
any way conduce to a satisfaction in any sin, he will be sure to speak
of it in its highest praises</i>. He not only stretcheth his rhetoric to the
height in giving commendations to the most noted pleasures that
men propound to themselves, but he seeks out the hidden things of
delight, and raiseth in men an itch of desire after the improvement of
delight, by the contrivances of wit or art. Thus he tells them of
jollity, ravishing mirth, high satisfaction, and, if they will believe him,
of unspeakable delight to be had by giving themselves up to the
world and the course of it. Nay, he hides nothing that will bear any
praise; the least advantage, the smallest gratification that any sin can
afford to human desire, he will be sure to speak of it.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>He carries on this design by lying</i>. He promiseth
more than ever sin can give, and he sends his proselytes out after sin
under the highest expectations, and when they come to enjoy it, they
often find the pleasure falls short of his boast. He whispers honours,
preferments, and riches, in the ear of their hearts, and often pays
them with poverty and disgraces, and gives them <i>pro thesauro carbones</i>,
stones for bread, a serpent for a fish. Witches give frequent accounts
of Satan’s lying promises; he tells them of feasts, of gold, of riches,
but they find themselves deluded; he sends them oft hungry away
from those banquets, so that they have no more than when a man
dreams he eats. He gives that which seems gold in appearance, but
at last they find it to be slates or shells. We find in this temptation
he is liberal and large in his offers to Christ, and what he requires he
will have in present payment, but the reward for the service is future.
It is his business to engage men in sin by his promise of advantage,
but being once engaged, he takes not himself concerned in honour or
ingenuity for performance. Hence doth the Scripture fitly call the
pleasures of sin ‘lying vanities,’ a ‘vain show,’ a ‘dream;’ thereby
warning men from a forward belief of Satan’s promises, in that
they find by experience they shall be at last but lies and disappointments.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, To make his bait more taking, <i>he conceals all the inconveniences
that may attend these worldly delights</i>. He offers here
the kingdoms of the world to Christ, as if all were made up of pleasure.
Those cares, troubles, and vexations that attend greatness
and rule, he mentions not; their burden, hazard, and disquiet, he
passeth over. Thus in common temptations he is careful to hide from
men the miseries that follow these empty pleasures. So that often
men do not consider the mischief, till ‘a dart strike through their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
liver,’ Prov. vii. 23, and till a dear-bought experience doth inform
them of their mistakes.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>His power and work upon the fancies of men, is none
of the least of his ways whereby he advanceth the pleasures of sin</i>.
That he hath such a power, hath been discoursed before, and that a
fancy raised to a great expectation makes things appear otherwise
than what they are, is evident from common experience. The value
of most things depends rather upon fancy than the internal worth of
them, and men are more engaged to a pursuit of things by the estimation
which fancy hath begat in their minds, than by certain principles
of knowledge. Children by fancy have a value of their toys, and are
so powerfully swayed by it, that things of far greater price cannot stay
their designs, nor divert their course. Satan knows that the best of
men are sometimes childish, apt to be led about by their conceits,
and apt in their conceits to apprehend things far otherwise than what
they are in truth. Hence is it, as one observes,<a id="FNanchor_448_448" href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> that of thousands of
men that return from Jerusalem, or from Mount Sion, or from the
river Jordan, scarce can we find one which brings back the admiration
which he had conceived before he had seen them. Fancy doth
pre-occupate the mind with a high opinion of things; and these
exorbitant imaginations pass to such an excess, that men think to
find a satisfaction beyond the nature of these pleasures they aim at,
which hath these two inconveniences: the one, that this affects and
draws as powerfully as if they were all as real and high as they are
conceited to be; the other, that sight and fruition takes away the estimation,
and by a disappointment doth deaden and dull the affections
to what may be really found there. Thus Satan by one deceit makes
men believe that sin hath pleasure, which indeed it hath not, and by
that belief leads them on powerfully to endeavour an embracement of
them, and at last urgeth them with a delusion.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> In opposition to this deceit of the devil, we must learn to
esteem worldly delights as low as he would value them high. And
to this purpose the Scripture speaks of them in undervaluing language,
calling worldly pomp an opinion, a fantasy, a fashion or
figure, an imagination rather than a reality; and further enjoins us
not to admire these things in others, not to envy them that enjoyment
of them, nor to fret at our want of them, much less to be transported
with any angry passion about them, nor to concern ourselves in any
earnest pursuit of them.<a id="FNanchor_449_449" href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 4. Fourthly, <i>Satan in this temptation did not bravely speak
of these things, nor only make an offer in discourse, but he thought it
most conducible to his design to present them to his sight</i>. He knew
full well that the heart is more affected by sensible discoveries than
by rational discourses.</p>

<p>Note here, <i>That Satan in temptations of worldly pleasure, endeavours
to engage the affections by the senses</i>.</p>

<p>That it is Satan’s great business to work upon the affections, I have
shewed at large. Here he endeavoured to prepare the affections of
Christ, that so the motion, when it came, might not die, as a spark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
falling upon wet tinder, but that the affections being stirred up might
cherish the offer, and that the offer by a mutual warmth might more
inflame the affections that were heated before.</p>

<p>To this end he works by the senses, and would have Christ’s eye to
raise his affections of love, desire, hope, and whatever else might wing
his soul to activity. There is a great connexion betwixt the senses
and the affections. The senses bring intelligence unavoidably, and
are apt to stir up our powers to action. As the jackal is said to hunt
the prey for the lion, so do the senses for the affections, and both for
Satan.</p>

<p>It is also remarkable that Satan, endeavouring to make the eyes of
Christ traitors to his affections, and that he thinking it necessary to
give him a view of what he proffered him, should not give him time
to take a full survey of these kingdoms, but should huddle it up in
such a haste, that all, as Luke tells us, was done in ‘a moment of
time.’ Was Satan in haste? or was he unwilling to part with what
he so liberally proffered? Surely no, but this transient view was his
subtlety, to entice him the more, and to inflame his heart with greater
desires.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 5. Observe then, <i>That where Satan is most liberal in his
proffers, he there manageth his overtures of advantage with a seeming
shyness</i>. And this he doth, <i>First</i>, To heighten the worth of them in
our estimation, as if they were jewels not to be gazed at, or curious
pieces not fit to be exposed to common view. <i>Secondly</i>, By this art
he makes men more eager in the pursuit. Our natural curiosity
presseth us with great earnestness after things of difficult access, and
we have also strange desires kindled in us from a prohibition, so that
what we list not to choose if we have a liberty of enjoyment, when we
are forbidden, we are troubled with impatient longings for it, and
cannot be at quiet till we do enjoy it: <i>nitimur in vetitum</i>.</p>

<p>When Satan makes nice with men, offering the pleasures of the
world, and yet hedging up the way with difficulties, they should
make no other construction of it, but that Satan doth, so far as he is
concerned, more strongly entice them. He plays at peep with them,
that he may make them more earnest to follow him, and to bid high
for the possession of these delights.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Satan’s ends in tempting Christ to fall down and worship him.—Of
blasphemous injections.—What blasphemy is.—The ways of Satan
in that temptation, with the advantages he takes therein, and the
reason of urging blasphemies upon men.—Consolations to such as
are concerned in such temptations.—Advice to such as are so
afflicted.</i></p>


<p>These observations, which the preparation to the temptation hath
afforded us, being despatched, the temptation itself follows, which is
this, ‘fall down and worship me.’</p>

<p>This motion, from such a one as Satan, to such a one as Christ,
who was holy and undefiled, God and man, seems to be an incredible
piece of arrogancy, pride, and malice; for to propound himself as the
object of divine worship, was certainly a desperate assault. It includes,
[1.] the highest blasphemy; [2.] the grossest idolatry imaginable.
Both these are frequently noted as the design of this temptation.<a id="FNanchor_450_450" href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>
But [3.] the comprehension of this motion takes in the whole withdrawing
of the mind from God and religion, or the care of the soul
and eternal life; in which sense Satan doth frequently practise this
temptation upon men by the motive of worldly pleasures. I shall
consider the temptation first, as blasphemous, and so it will give us
this observation:—</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 6. <i>That the best of God’s children may be troubled with most
vile and hideous blasphemous injections.</i></p>

<p>Blasphemy, in the largest sense, is anything spoken or done, by
which the honour and fame of God may be wounded or prejudiced;
but the formality of blasphemy lies in the purpose or intendment of
reproaching God. Such was the blasphemy of the Israelitish woman’s
son, recorded in Lev. xxiv. 11, where blaspheming is explained by the
addition of the word cursing, which in the original— קלל—comes from
a word that signifies to ‘set light by one.’<a id="FNanchor_451_451" href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> So that hence, and from
the circumstances of the story, we may safely conjecture that this man
having an Egyptian to his father, which probably might in scorn be
objected to him by his contending adversary, he more readily might
be drawn out to vilify the true God; but, be it what it will, it was certainly
more than that blasphemy which the Rabbins fancy to be in the
repetition of naming the word Jehovah, which in reverence they either
leave out, as when they say, ‘the arm of the Almighty,’ or change it
into some other, as Adonai, or the like; and accordingly we may
observe, that reproaching God and blaspheming God are joined together,
as Ps. xliv. 16; Isa. xxxvii. 23.</p>

<p>In blasphemy, as the matter, there must be thoughts, words, or
actions that may aptly express a contempt or reproach of God; so also,
as to the form of it, there must be an intendment of reproaching.
Now though this be a sin which the heart of a servant of God would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
most abhor, yet Satan doth sometimes trouble the best with it. We
have an instance in Job. His design was to bring him to curse God,
for so he professeth in express terms; chap. i. 11, ii. 5, ‘Lay thine
hand upon him, and he will curse thee to thy face.’ And in prosecution
of this his boast, he breaks the matter plainly to him by his
wife, chap. ii. 9, ‘Curse God and die.’ Whatever may be spoken of
the word as signifying blessing, though some affirm the word ברך,
in the proper idiom of that language, and not by an antiphrasis or
euphemismus, as some think,<a id="FNanchor_452_452" href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> signifies as properly to ‘curse’ as to ‘bless,’
and is determinable to its signification either way by the circumstances
of the place, or whatever men endeavour to excuse his wife, it is plain,
not only by Job’s answer, that it was evil counsel, but also by Satan’s
avowed design, that it was directly for cursing God. Besides this
instance, if we consider the expression of ‘fiery darts,’ Eph. vi. 16, we
shall find that this temptation is more common to all sorts of Christians
than we would imagine. It is plain that these words allude to
the poisoned arrows which Scythians and others used. These not
only wounded but poisoned, and the venom inflamed with a fiery heat
the part or member pierced. By this similitude, it must be granted
that not common temptations are hereby understood, but such as were
more than ordinarily hurtful, vexing, and dangerous. It may be
persecutions are one of these darts, but all reckon temptations of
spiritual terrors, and blasphemy, to be undoubtedly pointed at.<a id="FNanchor_453_453" href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p>The ways of Satan in this temptation are three:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, He endeavours to bring men to blaspheme, <i>by secret and
subtle ways of ensnaring them</i>; and this is most-what practised in
consequential and covert blasphemies, when, though men do not
directly intend an open outrage against God, yet Satan brings them
to that which might be so interpreted. This seems to have been the
case of Job’s sons, according to his jealousy of them; ‘It may be my
sons have sinned, and cursed God in their heart,’ Job i. 5; not that
they were open blasphemers, for they were surely better educated,
neither doth Job express such a fear of them; but that in their mirth
their hearts might have been so loosened from the fear of God, that
they might be tempted to undue thoughts of God, slighting his
threatenings or goodness. To this purpose Broughton translates,
‘They have little blessed God in their hearts.’<a id="FNanchor_454_454" href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> The same thing we
may observe in Job himself. When the devil could not prevail with
him to ‘charge God foolishly,’ chap. i. 22, yet he pressed him so hard
by his miseries, that he hoped at last to bring him to utter the anguish
of his mind in impatient and reflecting expressions, and so far prevailed,
that he bitterly ‘Curseth the day wherein he was born,’ chap.
ii. 3, and wisheth that he had ‘given up the ghost when he came out
of the belly;’ which though it came far short of what Satan had boasted
of in his achievement against him, yet it had such an unwarrantable
tendency that way, that when his friend Eliphaz took notice of his
expressions, as savouring of too much distrust, he is forced to make
apology for himself, and to excuse it by the desperateness of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
condition; chap. vi. 26, ‘Do you imagine to reprove words and the speeches
of one that is desperate?’ In such cases, the devil provokes men
beyond their intentions, to speak in their haste so inconsiderately, that
they know not or mind not, the just consequence of their speeches.
It was a degree of blasphemy in David to say, though in his haste,
that ‘all men were liars;’ it was an unbelieving reflection on the
promise given him by Samuel. In Mal. iii. 13, the people did not
believe that they had ‘spoken so much against God,’ when yet their
words had been ‘stout against him.’</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Satan endeavours this <i>by violent injections of blasphemous
thoughts that are directly such</i>. In this I shall note to you,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>That the vilest thoughts of God, of his ways and providences,
of Scripture, and of Christ, are frequently suggested</i>. Things
of greatest outrage against heaven, and contempt of the Almighty,
as Bernard expresseth it, <i>Terribilia de fide, horribilia de divinitate</i>;
as, there is no God, or that he is not just, or not faithful to his promises;
or that Christ was but an impostor. He sticks at nothing in
this kind, though never so contrary to the hope and persuasion of those
whom he thus molests.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>These are frequently reiterated upon them</i>, and their
minds so troubled by them, that they cannot free themselves from such
thoughts, but he follows on and clamours in their ears, as Gerson<a id="FNanchor_455_455" href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a>
observes, <i>Nega Deum, maledic Deo</i>—Deny God, curse God.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, And this with so great <i>a force and impetuosity, that
they are compelled to form these thoughts in their minds, and to speak
contrary to what they would</i>, as if their thoughts and tongues were
not under their own government, the devil not satisfying himself to
bear in these thoughts upon them, but he endeavours, as it were, to
make them say after him, and to cast his suggestions into their own
mould, that so they might seem properly to be their own; and this
they are forced to whether they will or no, even then when their
minds are filled with horror, their heart with grief, and their body
with trembling. I have discoursed with some who have bitterly complained
that their tongues and their thoughts seemed not to be their
own, but that Satan ruled them at his pleasure; and that when in
opposition to the temptation they would have formed their tongues to
speak blessing of God, they have spoken cursing instead of blessing;
and that when a blasphemous thought had been cast into their mind,
they could not be at rest till they had thought it again.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, These troublesome temptations are oft of <i>long continuance</i>.
Joannes Climacus tells us<a id="FNanchor_456_456" href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> of a monk that was troubled
with blasphemous thoughts for twenty years together, and could not
quit himself of them, though he had macerated his body with watchings
and fastings. Some have them going away and returning again
by fits, according as the prevalency and ferment of their melancholy
gives Satan the advantage of dealing thus with them. For if we
inquire why it is thus, especially with the children of God, we must
partly resolve it into the ‘unsearchable wisdom of God,’ who for holy
ends of teaching and disciplining his servants, permits Satan thus to
molest them; and partly into those particular advantages which Satan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
hath against them according to the variety of their conditions, which
usually are these:—</p>

<p><i>First</i>, He takes advantage of such <i>bodily distempers as do deprive
men of the use of their reason</i>, as fevers, frenzies, madness. In these
he oft forms the tongues of men to horrid blasphemous speeches.</p>

<p><i>Secondly, A pressure of outward afflictions</i> gives him his desired
opportunity; and this he knows to be generally so successful, that he
promised himself by this means a victory over Job. Ordinarily, straits
and miseries do produce blaspheming. Isa. viii. 21, the prophet notes
that when the people should be ‘hardly bestead and hungry,’ they
should ‘fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look
upward,’ as avouching what they had done.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly, Worldly plenty, fulness, and pleasure</i> lay often foundations
of this temptation. When their cups are full, and their hearts high,
Satan can easily make them ‘set their mouth against heaven.’ A
proud heart will readily say, ‘Our tongue is our own, or, Who is the
Lord?’ [Ps. xii. 4.] This was the engine which the devil managed,
if it were as Job suspected, against the sons and daughters of Job, to
make them curse God in their hearts; and by this did he seek to
prevail upon Christ in this blasphemous temptation.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly, A melancholy distemper doth usually invite Satan to give
blasphemous suggestions.</i> The disturbed and pliable fancies of such,
are the advantages which he improves against them.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly, Inward terrors and distresses of conscience</i> are also an occasion
to Satan to move them, as by a desperate humour, to utter hard
things of God and against themselves.</p>

<p>But there is yet a third way by which Satan tempts men to blaspheming,
<i>by sudden glances of blasphemous imaginations</i>, which like
lightnings do astonish the heart and then suddenly vanish. These are
very common, and the best of men observe them frequently. Satan
seems as it were rather to frolic and sport himself in these suggestions,
than to intend a serious temptation. Their danger is not so much,
yet are they not to be despised, lest these often visits, carelessly entertained,
and not dismissed with just abhorrency, do secretly envenom
the soul, and prepare it for stronger assaults.</p>

<p>I shall next inquire into the reasons of this trouble which Satan
gives the children of God.</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>These temptations are very affrighting; though they prevail
not, yet they are full of perplexing annoyance</i>. Corrupt nature startles
at them, and receives them not without dread and horror. It is sadly
troublesome to hear others blaspheme God. ‘The reproaches of those
that reproached thee,’ saith David, ‘fell upon me.’ It was as ‘a sword
in his bones’ to hear the blasphemous scoffs of the wicked, when they
said to him, ‘Where is thy God?’ And if it were confusion and
shame to him to hear ‘the enemy reproach and blaspheme,’ as he
professeth it was, Ps. xliv. 15, 16, how sadly afflicting would it be for
any child of God to observe such things in his own imaginations! If
there were no more in it than this, it is enough to put Satan upon
that design, because it is a troublesome kind of martyrdom.<a id="FNanchor_457_457" href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span></p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>This is also a spiteful revenge against God</i>. All he
can do is to blaspheme and rage, and it is a kind of delight to put this
force upon those that carry his own image. He would do all he can
to make his own children to vilify and reproach their heavenly Father,
and to render cursing for blessing.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, This temptation, <i>though it have not the consent or
compliance of God’s children, yet it opens a way to many other sins</i>,
as murmuring, distrust, despair, weariness of God’s ways and services.
When we find Satan thus to run upon us, it is apt to breed ‘strange
thoughts of God,’ that thus permits Satan to take us by the throat, or
to make us judge of ourselves as rejected of God, and given up to
Satan’s power; and if it do this, his labour is not in vain; we are, as
one observes,<a id="FNanchor_458_458" href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> more to fear his subtlety in bringing us by this into
other snares, than the violence of the adversary in this suggestion.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, This is a stratagem <i>for laying the foundation of direful
accusations</i>. The devil in this doth as the Russians are<a id="FNanchor_459_459" href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> reported
to do. They, when they have a spite against any of their neighbours,
hide secretly some of their goods in their houses, and then accuse
them of theft. When blasphemous thoughts are injected, and men
refuse to consent, then Satan raiseth an accusation against them, as
Joseph’s mistress did, as if they were guilty of all that blasphemy that
he tempted them unto; and it is a difficult task to persuade them that
these things should be in their minds, and that they should not be the
proper issues of their own heart. And very often doth he from hence
accuse them of sinning against the Holy Ghost, because of the hideous
blasphemies which he had first suggested to them.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> First, This will give us considerations of <i>consolation</i>, and
that—(1.) <i>In regard of others.</i> We observe often our sick friends
speak what we would not willingly hear, and it cannot choose but be
sadly afflictive to hear their curses and blasphemous speeches; but
when we consider the advantage that Satan takes of their distemper,
if their lives heretofore have been pious and religious, we comfort ourselves
in this, that it is more his malice than their own inclinations;
neither should we suffer our hope or charity to be distressed on their
behalf. (2.) It is the like ground of consolation for ourselves or others
that are violently afflicted with blasphemous thoughts. For,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>If we call to mind that our Lord and Master suffered
such things, we that are of his household need not think we receive a
strange or unusual measure in that we are molested as he was</i>.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, If we consider that Christ was tempted <i>without sin
on his part</i>, then may we fetch this conclusion from it, <i>that it is
possible that such thoughts should be cast upon us, and yet that we may
not be chargeable with them as our iniquities</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, We may hence see that such temptations <i>are more
frightful than hurtful</i>. These, as one observes,<a id="FNanchor_460_460" href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> seldom take, they
carry with them so much horror, to those that believe and love the
true God, that it keeps them from a participation with Satan in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
sin itself, nay, it fills them with fear and striving against it; they
rather, as bugbears, scare and disquiet them, than produce the real
effects of compliance with them.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> Secondly, The consideration of this kind of temptation may
<i>fill the hearts and mouths of those of us as have not hitherto been
troubled with it, with praise for so merciful a preservation</i>. If we
have not been under this kind of exercise, it is not from any good will
that Satan hath to us, but because our God withholds a commission
from him. A poor weak Christian wonders that Satan hath not
made him a mark for this arrow, that he hath not broken him with
this tempest. To answer that wonder, he may know that the same
tenderness in God, that will not put ‘new wine into old crazy bottles,’
nor a ‘new stiff piece of cloth into an old tender garment,’ nor that
will oppress the weak and infirm with strong exercise or burdens;
that same tenderness of a compassionate Father doth keep off such
trials, because he will not suffer them ‘to be tempted above what
they are able.’</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> Thirdly, This temptation calls for <i>advice to those that are
under it</i>, to whom I shall direct a few things.</p>

<p>[1.] First, When any are troubled with blasphemous thoughts, let
it be considered <i>in what state and temper their body is</i>. If it be distempered
with melancholy, as is most usual, then the prescription of
an able physician is necessary in the first place, without which he
that would spiritually advise or counsel shall but beat the air, and his
words be so far from the fastness of nails that they shall be as wind.
I have known many under great complaints and fears by reason
hereof, that have been cured by physic alone; for when, in this case,
the fuel is withdrawn, the fire goes out. Correct the melancholy
temper that gives the devil this advantage, and the trouble will
cease.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, It is of great consequence to understand <i>the nature
of these temptations</i>. If the tempted could see these to be their
sufferings rather than their sins, they would with greater ease bear it
as an affliction. And to those that complain, abhor, resist, and pray
against them, they are not sins, no more than when a harlot layeth her
child at an honest woman’s door, that child is to be reckoned as the
fruit of her wickedness. A giant may dash the son against his father,
but so far will the father be from imputing it as rebellious insolence
in his child, that he will pity him the more, as suffering by a double
injury; for it is not only against his natural affection and reverence to
his parent, but it is a bodily hurt beside. Thus will God much more
pity his children under these sufferings.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, We must not suffer such thoughts <i>to lodge in us</i>, but
before they settle, if possible, we must repel them; as Abraham
drove away the fowls that came down upon his sacrifice. I know the
tempted will say this advice is not practicable; they find these
thoughts swarm about them as bees, and when one is driven back
another straight comes in its place. But to them I answer, that
blasphemous thoughts are repelled two ways. (1.) By stout and
resolute resistance. This, though it do not extinguish them, nor free
us of the trouble, yet it keeps them from settling upon us, and us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
from the guilt of them. (2.) By diversion, which the work of a
lawful employment, or good society, and other discourses may do.
This may give some ease from the molestation, and the other preserves
us innocent.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, In temptations to blasphemy <i>confident refusals do
better than disputings</i>.<a id="FNanchor_461_461" href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> Here we are to resist with courage and a
holy contempt of Satan. If we be too timorous and fearful, he insults
the more upon us; as dogs when they are observed follow the passenger
with greater eagerness and noise. Abhorrences and positive
discharges, like that of Christ in the same case, ‘Get thee hence,
Satan,’ do more for us than to debate the matter with him.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The nature of idolatry.—Satan’s design to corrupt the worship of
God.—The evidences thereof, with the reasons of such endeavours.—His
general design of withdrawing the hearts of men from God
to his service.—The proof that this is his design.—Upon whom he
prevails.—That professions and confidences are no evidences to the

evidences of that method, and the reason thereof.</i></p>


<p>Thus have I considered the temptation as blasphemous. I proceed
next to consider it as idolatrous. The words ἐὰν πεσὼν
προσκυνήσῃς, if thou wilt fall down and worship, do give us the true
notion of idolatry. The word which we call <i>worship</i> comes from κύω,
which signifies to kiss, or from κυὼν, which signifies a dog, both being
to the same purpose, and signifying any action of reverence by which
we signify the respect of our minds. To kiss the hand, or to fawn as
a dog, are gestures which express the honour we would give, and
being applied to divine worship before, or with respect unto, an undue
object, is idolatry; and as such doth Christ reject it in his answer,
‘Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
serve.’ We worship God, when in ways and actions commanded or
prescribed, we testify our belief and resentment of his incommunicable
attributes. It is idolatry when either we use the same actions of
prescribed worship to that which is not God, or when we testify our
respects to the true God in an undue way of our own devising. Here
might I take occasion to shew the vanity of the popish subterfuges;
their distinction of <i>latria</i> and <i>dulia</i> is, as Dr [Henry] More observes,
hereby overthrown.<a id="FNanchor_462_462" href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> Satan doth not here set himself up as the
omnipotent God, for he acknowledgeth one superior to himself, in
that he confesseth that the power he had of the kingdoms of the
world was given to him, Luke iv. 6, and therefore not the <i>latria</i> but
the <i>dulia</i> is required of him; and yet this, Christ denies him as being
idolatry, in that no religious worship—for that must needs be the
sense of his answer—is due to any but God alone. Their other distinction
of worshipping an idol, saint, angel, cross, &amp;c., and before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
such a creature, is also hereby crushed, as is commonly observed:<a id="FNanchor_463_463" href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> for
what the evangelist Matthew expresseth by προσκυνήσῃς μοι, Luke
calls ἐνώπιόν μου, before me; so that the Scripture makes no difference
betwixt these two, shewing it to be idolatry to use religious worship
to that which is not God, or before it. But these things I shall not
prosecute; keeping therefore to my design, I shall observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 7. <i>That it is one of Satan’s great designs to corrupt the worship
of God.</i> That this is so will appear,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>If we consider what varieties of worship hath been in
the world</i>. God gave a fixed and stable law, and yet this so little
prevailed, that men were upon new inventions presently. I shall not
need to reckon up the almost numberless varieties of this kind among
the heathen. The instance is plain enough in those that professed
the name of the true God; they were still changing for new fashions
in religion, borrowing patterns from their neighbours, so that if there
were but a new altar at Damascus, or a new idol in any strange city,
they must presently have the like, till, as the prophet tells them,
‘according to their cities so were their gods,’ [Jer. ii. 28.] He that
will call to mind that the husbandman did first ‘sow good seed in his
field,’ and that there is such variety of tares and false worship, notwithstanding
the plain and positive command of God, fixing and
determining his worship, must needs conclude that an enemy, Satan,
hath done it.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>If we call to mind how in all ages there hath been a
constancy in this inconstant variety</i>. We hear of it among the
heathens. We read enough of it among the Jews, and when they
were out of the humour of more shameful idolatries, they yet corrupted
the worship of God by their traditions; and of these they were so fond,
that they caused the law of God itself to give place to them, and made
it void by them. The times of the gospel were not free. Though
Christ came to seek such worshippers as should ‘worship him in
spirit and in truth,’ yet before the apostles’ deaths, while yet they were
persuading to the contrary, there arose up some that corrupted the
worship, by leading the people back again to the Jewish ceremonies,
and others laboured to bring in ‘worshipping of angels,’ and at last
to ‘eat things offered to idols,’ with greater defilements. Since the
apostles’ days the same design hath been carried on in the churches.
Rome hath patched together a great deal of Jewish and heathenish
ceremonies; and when the man of sin shall be revealed, yet a higher
flood of such abominations is to be expected. Who hath wrought all
this, but Satan? This is still the same design, and though the work
be not in all parts like itself, yet the whole of it evidenceth the working
of the same spirit in all.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>Let us observe how early this began</i>. We cannot say
but that in the days of Adam, who doubtless had received particular
commands from God, in which he would not fail to instruct his
children, they were seeking to themselves ‘many inventions,’ Gen. iv. 26.
At the birth of Enos, as some conjecture, there were such defilements
brought into use in worship, that Seth had respect to it when he
called his son Enos, <i>Sorrowful</i>, as lamenting that profanation which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
was then begun in ‘calling upon the name of the Lord,’ for so do
many interpret that passage, which in our English we read thus,
‘Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.’ The word in
the original is הוחל, which signifieth both to <i>profane</i> and to <i>begin</i>,
and may be as properly translated, then ‘profaned they in calling
upon the name of the Lord.’ And there are several reasons that move
learned men<a id="FNanchor_464_464" href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> to fix upon this translation. As (1.) That it is not
probable that men began then to call upon God, or publicly to do so,
as some would interpret, and not before, as the present English would
imply. (2.) That age was noted as corrupt, and therefore it is noted
as a rarity that Enoch walked with God. (3.) The Rabbins generally
translate  חלל to <i>profane</i>; but if we should grant the present English,
‘Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord,’ it would imply
that the worship practised by Adam and Abel had been corrupted,
and now it was restored again and reformed; which will make the corruption
of worship to be yet more early. And after that we read of
corruption crept into the family of Seth, as well as now in the family
of Cain, Gen. vi. 2; so that the worship of God stood not long in its
honour, though Adam and Seth were alive to instruct them; which
shews that it was a rebellious departure from the way, fomented and
brought on by the malignant spirit Satan.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, But to make all sure, <i>the Scripture lays all these
kinds of corruption of worship at Satan’s door</i>. The defilements of
worship taught in Thyatira, by Jezebel, are called ‘the depth of
Satan,’ Rev. ii. 24; the corruptions introduced by antichrist, are from
‘the workings of Satan,’ 2 Thes. ii. 9. What was promoted by false
apostles to that purpose, they had it from their great teacher Satan,
who ‘transforms himself for such ends into an angel of light,’ 2 Cor.
xi. 13, 14; so that nothing can be more plain than that this is an old
and constant design of Satan.</p>

<p>The particular ways by which Satan effects this design I shall not
now touch, but shall in lieu of that give you the reasons of his endeavours
this way.</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>He knows that this is a sin of a high provocation</i>.
Worship is the proper tribute that is due to God, and it is peculiarly
his prerogative to prescribe the way and manner of it. Neither of
these honours will he give to any other, but will express his jealousy
when any invasion is made upon these his sole prerogatives. Now his
worship cannot be corrupted, but one of these at least will in some
degree or other be touched. If we set up another object of worship,
we deny him to be God; if we worship him in a way of our own invention,
we deny his wisdom, and set up ourselves above him, as if we
could order his worship better than he hath done in his word.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>If the worship be corrupted, all the exercise of the
affections of the heart, and all the service itself is lost, and become unacceptable</i>.
He knows that such worshippers shall meet with this
answer, ‘Who hath required this at your hands?’ [Isa. i. 12.]</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>Corruption in worship</i>, Satan by long experience
knows to have been the ground of those hatreds, quarrels, persecutions,
and troubles under which the church hath groaned in all ages, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
difference imposing their way and persuasion upon all dissenters, to
the disturbance of peace, breach and decay of love, hindrance of the
growth of piety, to the biting and devouring of one another.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, Besides God is provoked by this to <i>leave his sanctuary</i>,
to remove his glory and his candlestick, to make his vineyard a desolation,
and his churches as Shiloh.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, Satan is the more industrious in this, because <i>his ways
are capable of many advantages to further his design, and many
specious pretences to cover it</i>. In Col. ii. 8, he made use of philosophy
to corrupt religion, and by unsound principles of some heathens famous
for that learning, introduced ‘worshipping of angels.’ What that
could not effect he laboured to perform by ‘the traditions of men,’
and where that came short, ‘the rudiments of the world’—the Mosaical
ceremonies were so called here, and in the Epistle to the Hebrews—were
his engine by which he battered the plain worship of the New
Testament. And as to pretences, the apostle doth there and elsewhere
note that decency and order, humility, wisdom, and self-denial, are
things very taking, and yet usually pretended for such bold innovations
as may corrupt the pure streams of the sanctuary.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> Hence may I leave with you a few memorials.</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>This may make us jealous of any alterations in the way
of Gods worship</i>. We have reason under the most plausible pretexts
to suspect the hand of Satan, because it is one of his main businesses
to corrupt the worship.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>This may justify those that out of a conscientious
fear of complying with Satan’s design, dare not admit of a pin in the
tabernacle beside what God hath prescribed, nor leave behind a shoe-latchet
of what he hath enjoined</i>.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>This will tell us that that worship is best and safest
that hath least of mixture of human invention</i>. We cannot offend in
keeping close to the rule, though the worship thereby become more
plain, and not so gorgeous in outward appearance. We may soon
overdo it by the least addition, and cannot be so certain of God’s
acceptation, as we are of pleasing the senses of men, by such introducements.</p>

<p>This motion of Satan, ‘Fall down and worship me,’ is now in the
last place to be considered as a particular instance of Satan’s general
design <i>of drawing the hearts of men from God his service and ways,
to the pleasures of sin</i>; as if he should say to him, follow my advice,
give up thyself to my service, and thou shalt be gratified with all the
delights that the world can give thee. To this doth the bait here
offered most fitly agree. Hence observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 8. <i>That it is Satan’s general design to withdraw the hearts of
men from God, that they may be enslaved to him in the service of sin.</i></p>

<p>That the devil doth level all his endeavours to this, cannot be
doubted; for,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>He hath a kingdom in this world</i>, from which he is denominated
‘the prince of this world.’ And this is not only a rule of
exterior force, such as conquerors have over their captivated slaves,
who are compelled to subject their bodies, while yet their minds are
full of hatred against him who hath thus forced them to subjection;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
but it is a rule over the hearts and affections of men, working in ‘the
children of disobedience’ a love and liking of these ways, and begetting
in them the image of Satan; so that what work he imposeth they are
pleased withal, and ‘love to have it so.’ Therefore he is not only
called their prince, but their god and their father: ‘Ye are of your
father the devil,’ in that with a kind of inward devotion they will and
endeavour to perform the lusts which he propounds to them.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>This kingdom is contrary to Gods spiritual kingdom</i>,
that being of darkness, this of light; and it is managed by Satan with
an envious competition and co-rivalship to that of God; so that as
God invites men to the happiness of his kingdom, and sends his Spirit
in his word and ordinances to persuade them, Satan doth the like.
He sends out his spirit, which the apostle calls ‘the spirit of the
world,’ 1 Cor. ii. 12, and employs all his agents to engage men for
him. He requires the heart as God doth, he promiseth his rewards
of pleasure, honour, riches, if they will fall down and worship him.
Now it is so natural to prosecute an interest thus espoused in a way
of opposition, especially to any other that set up for themselves in a
contradictory competitorship, that the very natural laws of Satan’s
kingdom will engage him to stand up for it, and to enlarge it all he
can.</p>

<p>Those upon whom he prevails are of two sorts—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>Some are visibly in his service</i>. These answer the
character which was given of Ahab, 1 Kings xxi. 20, ‘who sold himself
to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord.’ The first expression
shews that such are wholly in Satan’s power and disposal—as
things sold are in the possession and power of the buyer—they are at
Satan’s will. If he say to them, ‘Go, they go,’ and if he say, ‘Come,
they come.’ Their bodies and spirits are Satan’s, they are not their
own; and they are his for the ends of sin, for that employment only,
so that they are ‘wholly corrupt and abominable.’ The latter expression,
that he did so ‘in the sight of the Lord,’ manifests their
shameless impudency in sin, that they ‘declare their sin as Sodom,
and hide it not,’ that they do not blush, but openly wear the devil’s
livery and avouch his service. As the works of the flesh are manifest,
so these in their practice of such works are manifestly Satan’s subjects.
These kind of men are frequently in the Old Testament styled
‘sons of Belial,’<a id="FNanchor_465_465" href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> a name very significant, shewing either their devoting
of themselves to the devil’s service, in that they reject the yoke of
God’s law, in that they ‘break his bonds, and cast his cords from
them,’ or their pride that they will have none above them, not considering
that there is a God, or that the Most High rules, or their
averseness to what is good, being ‘wholly unprofitable, and to every
good work reprobate.’ [Titus i. 16.]</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>Some are secretly his servants</i>. They come to the
devil, as Nicodemus did to Christ, by night. They will not openly
profess him, but yet their hearts are wholly his. Such are called by
the name of hypocrites. The pharisees and scribes seemed to declare
for God, called themselves Abraham’s seed, fasted, gave alms, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
long prayers, and yet were a ‘generation of vipers,’ and ‘of their
father the devil.’ The secrecy of this underhand engagement to hell
is such, that many who are in a league with the devil, and at an
agreement with death, do neither know nor believe it concerning
themselves. For,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>This private covenant may be where there are the greatest
seeming defilements of Satan and high professions of service to God</i>.
The pharisees, as have been said, were the devil’s servants, under all
the fair show they made of religion and zeal for the law, and yet
when Christ plainly told them that they were not Abraham’s seed
but the devil’s seed, they with high indignation and scorn throw back
the accusation to Christ, ‘Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil; we
are Abraham’s children,’ [John viii. 48,] so little believed they the
truth when it was told them.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>This may consist with some designment and intention
to give God glory</i>. The Jews, though they submitted not to the
righteousness of God, yet, by the testimony of Paul, they had a zeal to
God. The very heathens that sacrifice to devils had not formal intentions
so to do, as appears by their inscription on the altar at
Athens, Acts xvii. 23, ‘To the unknown God.’ The true God,
though unknown, they propounded as the object of their worship; yet
falling into those ways of devotion which the devil had prescribed,
these intentions could not hinder but that they became his servants.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>Men may be servants to Satan under great assurances
and confidences of their interest in God</i>. Many go to hell that have
lived with <i>Lord, Lord</i> in their mouths. Those mentioned in Isa.
xlviii. 2, that had no interest in truth and righteousness when they
solemnly sware by the name of the Lord, ‘yet they called themselves
of the holy city, and stayed themselves upon the God of Israel,’ [Isa.
xlviii. 2.]</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> If it seem strange to any that these professions, intentions, and
confidences are not enough to secure men from this charge, but that
they may be secretly slaves to hell, I answer,</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> 1. First, <i>That those do not necessarily conclude that the heart
of such men is right with God</i>. Formality, natural conscience, and the
power of education may do much of this; for though we grant that
such are not conscious to themselves of any real design of serving Satan,
yet they may either so far miss it in the way of their service, offering
that as well-pleasing to God, which indeed he hates, and that through
wilful and affected ignorance, as those of whom Christ speaks, John
xvi. 2, that should think the killing of God’s children a piece of acceptable
service; or they may be so mistaken as to the sincerity of
their hearts that they may think they have a design to please God in
doing of what he requires in order thereunto, when indeed it may not
be singly for God but for themselves that they work, in a self-gratification
of their natural zeal for their way; or their esteem, credit, and
advantage may privately influence them, rather than a spirit of life
and power.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> 2. Secondly, <i>The work which they do, and the ends they serve,
will be evidence against professions and intentions</i>. It is a sure rule,
that the work shews to whom men are related as servants, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
laid down as a certain standard to measure the hearts of men by,
when pretences and persuasions seem to carry all before them: Rom.
vi. 16, ‘His servants ye are to whom ye obey;’ 1 John iii. 8, 10, ‘He
that committeth sin is of the devil: in this the children of God are
manifest, and the children of the devil’—that is, when it becomes a
question to whom a man belongs, whose child and servant he is, it
must be determined by the works he doth. If he engage in the ways
of sin, he is of the devil, let him profess what he will to the contrary.
This same balance Christ useth to try the truth of the Jews’ pretences
to God: John viii. 34, ‘Whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of
sin;’ they boasted high, but he shews them that seeing their designs
and works were hatred, envy, murder, &amp;c., which are apparently from
Satan, it was evident they had learned these of him; and he concludes
by this proof, ver. 44, ‘that they were of their father the devil.’
Thus may we say of those that pretend they honour God, they deify
the devil, they intend well, if yet they give themselves up to the
pleasing of the flesh, if worldly-minded, if they live in pride, strife,
envy, maliciousness, &amp;c.,—which are works of the devil,—it is not all
their pretences that will entitle them to God, but they are, for all
this, the devil’s servants, as doing his works.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This may put men upon inquiries, <i>Who are ye for? whose
servants are ye?</i> There are but two that can lay claim to you, and
these two divide the whole world betwixt them. There is no state of
neutrality: you are either God’s servants or the devil’s. Ye cannot
serve them both; ‘now if the Lord be God, serve him.’ Satan’s
service is base, dishonourable, slavish; the service of God, freedom,
honour, life, and peace; there is indeed no comparison betwixt them.
Happy, then, is that man that can say the Lord is his lot and portion;
that can come into God’s presence, and there in his integrity avouch
the Lord for his God—that can stand upon it. ‘My soul hath said
unto the Lord, Thou art my God, and I have none besides thee; other
lords have had dominion over us, but we will make mention of thy
name only,’ [Isa. xxvi. 13.]</p>

<p>This temptation, though it were in itself horrid, and as a brood of
vipers knotted together, which at once could send out several stings,
and make many wounds,—as hath been noted,—yet in the way of
propounding, Satan seems to insinuate the largeness of his proffer, and
the smallness and inconsiderableness of the service required, as if he
should say, ‘See how free I am in my kindness; I will not stick to
give thee the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, and all
this for so small a matter as bowing before me, or doing me a little
reverence.’ This gives us to observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 9. <i>That when Satan doth design no less than to enslave men to
his service, yet he will propound sin as a small thing, or but one act of
sin, as a thing not valuable, to engage them to him.</i> Not but that he
desires to run men to excess in wickedness, and delights to see them
with both hands earnestly work iniquity with greediness; yet where
he sees the consciences of men squeamish, and that they cannot bear
temptations to open and common profaneness without danger of revolt
from him, there he seems modest, and requires but some small thing,
at least at first, till the ways of sin become more familiar to them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
then when they can better bear it, he doubles the tale of bricks, and
with greater confidence can urge them to things of greater shame and
enormity. That this is his way appears,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>From the common argument which he useth at first to
those whom he would draw off from a more careful conversation</i>,
which is this: Do such a thing, it is but for once, and but little;
others do the like, and demur not, or the best do as great matters as
this comes to. It is but a small thing, considering the strait, or the
advantage that may accrue. This is his usual note to candidate iniquity,
as experience of all doth testify.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, That this is so is also evident from a consideration of
<i>the several ways and courses of sinners</i>. Some are tempted and overcome
by one kind of sin, and not at all urged to others. Some go to
hell in a way of covetousness; others are pretty unblameable in most
of their carriages, but are overcome by a proud humour; others are
given to drink, and yet will not steal nor deal falsely; others take a
more cleanly way to hell, rely upon their own righteousness, or are
engaged in error, and their life otherwise smooth and fair. The Jews
in Christ’s time were only engaged against Christ, and for their traditions,
but not molested with temptations to open idolatry as formerly.
Those who are ignorant are not troubled with temptations to
despair, or inward terrors. The reasons of his dealing thus are these:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>He sees that one sin heartily prosecuted is enough to signify
homage to him, and to give him possession</i>. As we take possession
of land by a turf or a twig, so by one sin admitted with full purpose
of mind, Satan is let into the heart. As a penny will be sufficient
earnest for a bargain of a thousand pounds, so may one sin be a pledge
or earnest for the whole soul in a league with hell.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>He knows that one sin persisted in may be enough to
destroy the soul</i>; as one wound may kill, one leak may sink a ship.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>He knows that one sin breaks the covenant of God</i>, and
turns the heart from him, if men give up themselves to it.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>One sin wilfully pursued makes a man guilty of the
breach of the whole law</i>. It destroys love and respect to God, undervalues
his authority, contemns his threatenings and promises.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, <i>One sin is enough to make way for more</i>. Where
Satan would have more, yet at first he is pleased with it as a hopeful
beginning. It makes room enough for the serpent’s head, and then
he will afterwards easily wind in his whole body.</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> This may warn us not to be emboldened to any sin by the
plea <i>of diminution</i>; not to venture because it may seem little, or be
but for once. A true Christian should be a perfect universalist; he
should be universally against all sin, and universally for all duty.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXI_3">CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of worldly pleasure.—Proofs that this is Satan’s great engine.—What
there is in worldly delights that make them so.—Counsels and
cautions against that snare.</i></p>


<p>I come now to the argument which Satan used for all this, ‘All
these things will I give thee.’ He casts a golden apple before him,
and seeks to entangle him by worldly greatness and delight. I shall
not examine how true or false Satan spake when he called all these
things his, and that he could give them to whom he would. It is
enough for our purpose to take notice of his pretence, so far as might
make his offer probable; and then observe,</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 10. <i>That the great engine which Satan useth to draw away the
heart from God to his service is worldly pleasures and delights.</i></p>

<p>I shall first shew that this is Satan’s great engine, and then explain
what is in it that fits it so much for his purpose. The first of these
is evidenced by these particulars:—</p>

<p>1. First, The Scripture doth particularly note to us <i>a deceit or guile
to be in worldly pleasures</i>. Christ, in Mat. xiii. 22, speaks of ‘the
deceitfulness of riches;’ and that deceit is expressed by such a word
as signifies ‘a drawing out of the way,’ a misleading;<a id="FNanchor_466_466" href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> so that he
means not the uncertainty of these delights, in which sense it is said
‘that riches take themselves wings and fly away,’ [Prov. xxiii. 5,]
which often disappoint and deceive the expectations of those that do
most hug them. Nor can this be understood of riches in an active
sense, as we attribute deceit to men, who as rational agents can contrive
and devise snares; but it only means that these are so <i>objective</i>
as things that are abused by Satan to delude and betray the sons of
men: and these are so frequently made use of by him for such purposes,
and with such advantages of power and provocation, that Christ
elsewhere, Mat. xix. 23, speaks of it as a thing almost impossible, to
have riches and not to be ensnared by them: ‘A rich man shall hardly
enter into the kingdom of heaven,’ [Mat. xix. 23,] which Mark and
Luke express by an affectionate amazement, ‘Oh, how hardly can a
rich man be saved!’ [Mark x. 23-25, and Luke xviii. 24, 25.]</p>

<p>2. Secondly, <i>These are Satan’s great net which encloseth multitudes</i>;
a general bait, by which most are hooked into the service of sin.
Most temptations come from this ocean as springs from the sea. ‘The
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life,’ have their
original from the world, 1 John ii. 16. Christ speaks of this ‘mammon
of unrighteousness’ as the only thing that stands up in competition
for the hearts of men against God, Mat. vi. 24; and the apostle,
2 Tim. iii. 4, reckoning up the various ways of particular lusts, as
covetousness, boasting, pride, blaspheming, &amp;c., concludes them all
under this, that they ‘are lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
God;’ shewing us thereby, that though the lusts of men might run
out diverse ways, and be exercised upon diverse particular objects, yet
they all borrow their original from worldly pleasures, and their design<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
is nothing but that in the general. Hence it is that some make the
world the great traitor to God; for though they reckon up three great
enemies to God and man, ‘the world, the flesh, and the devil,’ yet
‘these three agree in one;’ the pleasing of the flesh is the great end
and desire of natural men; the world is the storehouse, from which
men draw out several pleasures, according to the several ways they
take in gratifying their lusts and humours, and the devil is only
officious to help all this forward, by enticing and persuading them to
‘make these provisions for the flesh.’ And who can think other, but
that this must be Satan’s great engine, when, as hath been said, <i>first</i>,
the world, and the pleasures of it, is the sum of all iniquity, containing
in it virtually or actually the transgression of the whole law. The
root it is of all evil, 1 Tim. vi. 10; all profaneness against God, all
neglect of duty, all outrage, wrong, or injustice to man, may, and
usually doth, spring from hence, insomuch that some have particularly
traced it through every command of the decalogue, and found it guilty,
either as principal or accessary, of every iniquity. <i>Second</i>, Our
thoughts may be the more confirmed in this when we see all men
entangled by it; for albeit that some temptations seem directly to
carry men from a love or care of the world, as despair, terrors of mind,
voluntary humility, neglecting of the body, and others of the same
kind; yet if the matter be considered, the truth in hand cannot be
prejudiced by such an objection. For, [1.] Those who seem in distress
of conscience most to loathe the world were yet first entangled
by it, and the consideration of that guilt, whether at present justly or
unjustly charged upon them, is the usual occasion of these troubles.
And, [2.] Those who seem to undervalue money, riches, plenty, &amp;c.,
are, it may be, no less slaves to other worldly lusts; for pleasures
of the world comprehend whatsoever may arise from anything that is
in the world to the delight of life. Honour, pride, ambition, prodigality,
are ‘worldly lusts,’ as well as covetousness and desire of power or
rule. And those that seem to deny themselves of ‘faring deliciously,’
or ‘wearing soft raiment,’ may be as much distressed with an inward
desire of applause and honour, as those that would gratify their senses
are by sensual lusts.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, How much the world stands Satan in stead may be
observed from <i>the force of that temptation upon those that have very
much engaged in their profession of the ways of God</i>. It hath often
fetched off those that seemed to have given up themselves to God.
Demas was once commended by Paul as his fellow-labourer, Philem.
24; yet at last it so prevailed upon him that he complained, 2 Tim.
iv. 10, that ‘Demas had forsaken him,’ and turned his back upon his
profession, and so far, if Dorotheus do him right, that he became
an idol-priest in Thessalonica, the cause of which horrid apostasy was
his ‘love to the present world.’ Balaam seemed resolute not to act
anything against Israel, yet ‘the ways of unrighteousness’ so far
blinded him, that he taught Balak ‘to cast a stumbling-block before
the children of Israel.’ The highest of nominal professors, noted by
the ‘thorny ground’ in Mat. xiii. 22,—who seemed to differ from
the good ground only in this, that their fruit was green and not ripe,
as Luke expresseth it, ‘They brought not fruit to perfection,’—they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
were choked in these fair beginnings and offers for holiness by the
‘cares and pleasures of the world.’ All ages abound with instances
of this kind. Æneas Sylvius preached against the pope, set up the
council above him, commended the Germans for opposing him; but
preferment made him alter his note, and at last he became pope himself.
Bonner, the persecutor, seemed at first a good man, a favourer
of Luther’s doctrine, but advancement changed him to a bloody wolf,
a cruel tiger. Spalato forsook popery, but, missing those dignities
which he aimed at in England, was, upon hopes of greater preferment,
induced to lick up his vomit, and to own popery again. How many
examples have we of those who, the higher they grew in the world,
became more careless of religion; as Sixtus Quintus, who went as fast
back in religion as he went forward in promotion; so that he that at
first entering into orders, had a good hope of his salvation, by that time
he came to be pope, he became so wicked that he despaired of happiness.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, <i>This temptation is one of Satan’s last refuges, and often
prevails where persecution cannot</i>. The thorny-ground hearers were
above those of the stony ground in this, that they stood out the storm,
and bore the scorching heat of persecution, but then the world choked
them. Sad experience tells us that churches that did thrive and grow
as the palm-tree under their pressures, were spoiled by ease and plenty,
which so cherished the seeds of pride, vanity, and contention, that
they grew up amain, and did more to their desolation than the cruelty
of all their fiercest enemies. Julian, who, by the greatest art and
policy, studied to overthrow the Christian’s name, so observed this,
that he made it his rule rather to corrupt men by honours than to
compel them by torments.<a id="FNanchor_467_467" href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> We have also found that though the
Roman synagogue join force to subtlety in the advancement of their
dagon, yet they have still looked upon this temptation of the world as
most likely to gain the hearts of their rational opposers. Cruelty could
overawe the senseless multitude, and could take out of the way those
of whose opposition they were afraid, but it seldom with success wrought
upon persons guided by light and conscience, to a compliance that
would hold long; for though at first some good men were overawed to
make subscription and to recant, as it did with Bilney, Bainham,
Cranmer, and several others,<a id="FNanchor_468_468" href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> yet upon the working of conscience,
after the stound and dazzle of the temptation was over, they recoiled
so resolutely upon them, that they lost more than they gained that
way. But those that were willing to nibble at preferments became
theirs wholly. Thus they set upon Luther, Galeaceus, Carracciolus,
Dr Taylor, and a great many more, though to no purpose, for they
were ready to bid their money ‘perish with them,’ and to bid defiance
to their favour as well as to their frowns. Notwithstanding they have
made many real conquests by this weapon, and accordingly this is
reckoned among the temptations of greatest force: Heb. xi. 37, ‘They
were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted,’ that is, by
the pleasures and preferments of the world. It seems the Holy Ghost
would point at this, how fair and plausible soever it be, as one of the
devil’s most powerful engines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span></p>

<p>Next, I promised to discover what it is in the world which makes it
so fit for Satan’s designs.</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>The world brings or affords fit matter to be made the
fuel of lust</i>. For this reason the apostle in the place afore-cited, 1 John
ii. 16, forbids us so earnestly to love the world, or the things of the
world, because there is nothing in it which is not improveable, as an
occasion or provocation to lust. Whatsoever is in the world is lust of
flesh, or eyes, or heart; and there is no lust but it may be furnished
with a proper object from hence. The appetite, senses, or affections
fetch all their delights from hence.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Besides the common materials of sin that are digged
out of this mine, the world hath something <i>of an aptitude in it to
tempt</i>. Not that it hath properly and formally, <i>insidiationis animum</i>,
an active subtlety to lay snares for men, but yet it is not so purely
passive as to make it altogether innocent. There is something of a
curse upon it ever since, by the fall of man. It was loosened from its
proper, primitive ends; and as the devil spake by the serpent, so doth
he urge, speak, tempt, and insinuate by the world, so that it is still an
occasion of danger to us, and hath a special advantage over our affections,
upon several accounts. As, [1.] In that it is in itself lawful to
be used. [2.] In that it is suitable to our desires and tempers. [3.]
In some respects it might be necessary and advantageous for the comfort
of life, for the support of families, and to enable us to be helpful
to others. [4.] It is near to us, under our eye; we have familiar converse
with it, it is still with us. [5.] We have a natural propensity
to be in love with it; the flesh would fain be pleased, and nothing is
more answerable to it than the pleasures of the world. We need not
wonder then, when we see it so highly captivating the affections of
men, and leading them bound in chains and fetters. Some make it
their god; gain is all their godliness and religion; they seek their
‘portion in this life,’ Ps. xvii. 14; this is their treasure, and here is
their heart; and it would be no less wonder if Satan should be guilty
of so much oversight, as to neglect the use of an instrument which is
every way so fitted for his purpose.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, Besides this fair prospect which it gives to sin, it hath
<i>an enmity to God and his ways, which is no less advantageous to the
devil</i>. This is positively affirmed, James iv. 4, ‘The friendship of this
world is enmity with God;’ not only is this true in a lower sense, as
a hindrance, being backward and averse to it, but it is a direct opposition
and contrariety to God and his service. Its drawing back and
hindering is charge enough against it: for it [1.] withdraws those
thoughts, affections, time, care, and endeavours, which should be laid
out upon better things, so that holiness must needs be obstructed,
dwindle, and decay by it. [2.] It hinders the influence of heaven; it
shuts out the light casually, quencheth and resisteth the Spirit, and,
meritoriously also, it provokes God to withdraw, to remove his glory,
and to give over his striving with them; but the contrariety that it
hath to all the parts of holiness is yet more: Christ notes it, Mat. vi. 24.
These two masters, God and the world, are contrary in their designs,
in their commands, in their natures, so that it is impossible for any
man to serve them both. They both require the heart, and they both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
require it to contrary and incompatible services and ends. These, then,
are such masters as would be <i>domini in solidum</i>, masters of the whole.<a id="FNanchor_469_469" href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">469</a>
Now there cannot be two masters of one thing in that sense; neither,
if there were, could the hearts of men serve these different commands,
but their work would necessarily engage their affections to one only;
they would either ‘love the one and hate the other, or hold to the one
and despise the other.’ This very consideration, if there were no more,
doth render the world a desirable instrument for Satan.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, In all this the world hath so many <i>cunning disguises,
and plausible shifts, that it becomes thereby wonderfully serviceable to
Satan</i>. It is the perfection of wicked policy to manage wicked designs
under plausible pretences. These the world hath in readiness when
it is accused of rebellion and treachery against God. The pleas of
necessity, of prosecution of a lawful calling, of providing for a family,
of not neglecting the benefits of God, of cheering the heart, and taking
the comforts of the labours of their hands, and a great many more,
are ready excuses to ward off the force of the convincing word. These
the devil drives home, and fastens them into such strong persuasions,
that the deluded sinner cannot see the danger that is before him, nor
the spiritual adultery or idolatry of his soul, in his excessive love to
worldly pleasures.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, The world hath also <i>a spiritual fascination and witchcraft</i>,
by which, where it hath once prevailed, men are enchanted to
an utter forgetfulness of themselves and God, and being drunk with
pleasures, they are easily engaged to a madness and height of folly.
Some, like foolish children, are made to keep a great stir in the world
for very trifles, for a vain show; they think themselves great, honourable,
excellent, and for this make a great bustle, when the world hath
not added ‘one cubit to their stature’ of real worth. Others are by
this Circe transformed into savage creatures, and act the part of lions
and tigers. Others, like swine, wallow in the lusts of uncleanness.
Others are unmanned, putting off all natural affections, care not who
they ride over, so they may rule or be made great. Others are taken
with ridiculous frenzies, so that a man that stands in the cool shade
of a sedate composure would judge them out of their wits. It would
make a man admire to read of the frisks of Caius Caligula, Xerxes,
Alexander, and many others, who because they were above many men,
thought themselves above human nature. They forgot they were
born, and must die, and did such things as would have made them,
but that their greatness overawed it, a laughing-stock and common
scorn to children. Neither must we think that these were but some
few or rare instances of worldly intoxication, when the Scripture notes
it as a general distemper of all that bow down to worship this idol.
They live ‘without God in the world,’ saith the apostle, [Eph. ii. 12,]
that is, they so carry it as if there were no God to take notice of them,
to check them for their madness. ‘God is not in all his thoughts,’
saith David, Ps. x. 4, 5. ‘The judgments of God are far above out
of their sight;’ he puffs at his enemies, and saith in his heart, ‘he
shall never be moved,’ &amp;c. The whole psalm describes the worldling
as a man that hath lost all understanding, and were acting the part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
a frantic bedlam. What then can be a more fit engine for the devil
to work with than the pleasures of the world?</p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> I shall briefly apply this to two sorts of men, those that are
straitened with want and necessities, and those whose ‘cups run over,’
having all ‘that their heart can wish.’</p>

<p>(1.) First, To those that think their measure of outward comforts
little, I would from the doctrine now explained tell them that <i>they
have not so much cause to vex and disquiet themselves for their poverty
or troubles as they apprehend</i>. The world is not so desirable a
thing as many dream. Did but men consider how great a snare it is,
and what dangers attend the fulness of it, they would not so earnestly
covet it, nor so passionately lament when it flies from them. If thou
hast so much godliness as can quiet thy heart in a contented enjoyment
of thy little, that little which thou hast is better than great
riches of the wicked. Thou little knowest from what pride, insolency,
contempt of God and men, and many other temptations and lusts, God
doth preserve thee, by denying thee earthly things. Thou art now, it
may be, often looking up to God, striving to believe his word, often
examining thy heart, labouring to live upon God and his all-sufficiency,
looking after the bread that endures to eternal life; when if
thou hadst the temptations of plenty, it may be feared thou wouldst
be another man, and be carried away to forget God, to be careless of
holy walking, and so make way for bitterness and sorrow at last.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, I would also caution poor men not <i>to enlarge their
desires too much after the world, but to fear the temptations of the
world</i>. It is not only a snare to those that enjoy it, but to those that
want it: for while they admire it, and engage their affections for it, it
ensnares them in sinful undertakings; they are tempted to lie, cheat,
dissemble, to use unlawful shifts, to rob, steal, overreach in bargaining,
and to neglect the care of the soul in all. Let such call to mind,
[1.] That often the providence of God doth of purpose thwart and
cross the designs of such, so that though they toil and sweat, running
from market to market, ‘rising early and sitting up late,’ yet he blows
upon their gettings, and they wither to nothing, ‘while it is yet in
their hand;’ or if they seem to keep them longer, yet all the end
they make with them is but to put them into a ‘bag with holes,’
[Haggai i. 6,] they ‘perish by evil travail,’ Eccles. v. 14. [2.] They
often are at a great deal of labour in pursuit, and then when the
desired object is within their reach, they are overwhelmed with their
disappointment, as if providence designed to mock them for their
folly. This is excellently set forth, in the emblem of a man climbing
up a rock, with great labour, to reach a crown that hung upon the
precipice, who when he had stretched himself to grasp it, falls down
and breaks his neck. [3.] And when they do by great toil rake together
a heap of riches, they are starved frequently in their plenty,
and so cursed that they have no more than ‘the beholding of their
goods with their eyes,’ in that God denies them a ‘heart to use them,’
Eccles. v. 11. [4.] Their gettings allay not their thirst for more, ‘He
that loveth silver, shall not be satisfied with silver,’ Eccles. v. 10.
[5.] Often they are given as a scourge and plague; as the quails
given to the Israelites ‘came out of their nostrils.’ The wise man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
notes it, Eccles. v. 13, ‘Riches are kept for the owners thereof to their
hurt.’</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, To those that have the delights of the world, plentiful
estates, full tables, beautiful houses, rich tradings, honours, and
dignities, I would desire to give the greatest caution, that they take
heed to themselves, <i>because they walk in the midst of snares</i>. They
should consider, [1.] That the great God hath laid most serious
charges upon them, ‘not to love the world,’ but to withdraw their
affections from it, nay, to be crucified to it, as to any captivating delight,
and to use it with such an indifferency of mind, that they
should be in their deportments towards it as ‘if they used it not.’
[2.] They should have their danger in their eye. How careful is he
of his steps that knows he walks in the midst of serpents which are
ready to sting him; the thoughts of this should blunt the edge of our
delights. If you were at a feast where you knew there were poisoned
dishes, you would be afraid to eat anything. Do you think that
Captain Smith<a id="FNanchor_470_470" href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> when he was taken by the savages of America, and
had plenty of meat set before him, which he knew was given to fatten
him that he might be better meat when he was killed, had any
stomach to eat or to drink? Was that feast pleasing to him that sat
under a sharp sword hung over his head in a horse hair, when he expected
every moment it should fall upon him and kill him?<a id="FNanchor_471_471" href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> Such
are great men, rich men. With what fear and care should they use
these things, when they know there is hazard of mischief from them
upon every occasion! How much doth Christ speak in that one
sentence, ‘It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven’! [Mat. xix.
24.] He means not that it is absolutely impossible, but extremely
difficult, and the difficulty lies in the hindrances which their riches
casts before them. [3.] They should carefully consider for what ends
God gives these, and to what use they are to be put. Rich men are
but God’s pursers; they do but ‘carry the bag,’ and what is put therein,
for public uses. If accordingly, as faithful stewards, they lay it
out upon those that have need, they shall ‘make friends of the unrighteous
mammon,’ and it will turn to a spiritual account: but if
they think that all is for themselves, and so shut their bowels and
purses from others, then they carry the bag no otherwise than as Judas
did, and will be easily persuaded to sell Christ and heaven for a little
more of earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span></p>




<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXII_3">CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Of Christ’s answer in the general.—That these temptations were upon
design for our instruction.—Of the agreement betwixt Eph. vi. and
Mat. iv.—The first direction.—Of courageous resolves in resisting
temptations.—Its consistency with some kind of fear.—The necessity
of this courage.—Wherein it consists; and that there is a
courage in mourning spirits.</i></p>


<p>These answers of Christ to the several temptations, which are now
to be explained, are different as to their matter, yet the general purport
of them being the same, I shall therefore handle them together.
They may be considered two ways:—</p>

<p>1. First, <i>As they are fit and pertinent answers to particular temptations,
of distrust, of presumption, of debauching the heart by worldly
delights to the service of Satan</i>; and thus may they be useful in their
consideration, to those who are directly moved by Satan to such sins.
And when at any time we are tempted in straits to cast away our
reliance upon the careful providence of God, we may look upon
Christ’s answer, that man’s life doth not so depend upon the usual
means, but that any other thing blessed by divine appointment may
be useful to that end. When we are enticed to presume of extraordinary
supports, then by Christ’s example the temptation may be
resisted, by considering, that however God be to be trusted, yet he is
at no time to be tempted by unnecessary expectations in the neglect of
the ordinary means. If our hearts be wooed by worldly delights to
cast off our care of God and religion, we may then call to mind that
this is abominable idolatry, and so may we turn off our hearts from
sinful compliance by charging our souls with the opposite duties, upon
a true discovery of the vileness and inconvenience of the transgressions
urged upon us.</p>

<p>2. But, secondly, They may be considered as they give <i>instruction
for the management of our spiritual armour against all Satan’s wiles
in the general</i>; and in this sense I shall endeavour to open them, laying
down first these two conclusions:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>That the whole business of these temptations, as permitted
to Satan, and submitted unto by Christ, was certainly upon design</i>.
The same wisdom that contrived the wonderful method of the salvation
of men by a Redeemer, did also order these temptations; for else
Christ could have prevented them, or by a divine authority commanded
silence to the tempter, and by his power might have chased him away.
As Christ told Pilate, ‘Thou couldst have no power at all against me,
except it were given thee from above,’ [John xix. 11;] thereby manifesting
that his suffering was from a higher design than he was aware
of; so might he have said to the devil, ‘Except this had been designed
by an eternal counsel, thou couldst not have made this attempt.’ So
that we must look further for the spring and rise of this, than to any
supposed occasional outbreaking of satanical malice upon him.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, That this design, however it touched upon the person
and offices of Christ, as mediator and second Adam, for thus it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
became him to overcome the enemy at the same weapon by which he
overcame our first parents, and by this personal experience, to be fitted
with feeling compassions to the tempted, yet was it <i>wholly for our
sakes</i>, as may appear by two things:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, In that Christ, if his answers had only concerned himself,
might have given other fit replies to the first temptation, of turning
stones to bread. He could have retorted the argument upon Satan,
as Jerome and others observe.<a id="FNanchor_472_472" href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> If I am not the Son of God, it is in
vain to require a miracle of me. If I am, it is in vain to tempt me.
Or he might have answered, ‘That as the Father hath life in himself,
so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself, and that by this
divine power he could sustain himself without bread.’<a id="FNanchor_473_473" href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> To the
second it might have been a sufficient answer to have excepted against
his unfaithfulness in citing that testimony out of Ps. xci., where, by
discovering his wilful omission of the clause, ‘in all thy ways;’ ‘He
shall keep thee in all thy ways;’ his temptation might have fallen to
the ground, as no way encouraged from that promise. To the third
might have been returned such answers as these: that Satan’s offer was
a lie; that it was not in his power to dispose of the kingdoms of the
world—that these were Christ’s already; that these were vain arguments
to draw him from the glory of a heavenly kingdom; and finally,
that of all creatures Satan, being God’s sworn enemy, had least reason
to expect divine honour.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, In that all Christ’s answers were from Scripture,
which is properly a ‘light to the steps of men,’ and all these scriptures
cited shew man’s duty. He saith not, ‘the Son of God shall not live
by bread alone,’ but ‘man lives not by bread alone;’ he saith not,
Christ must not tempt, but thou, man, shalt not tempt the Lord thy
God, &amp;c. By all which we may discern that Christ answered not by
arguments peculiarly agreeable to his person and nature, but by such
as suit the general state of God’s children. And this certainly was
for our advantage. He conquered with such weapons, not for any
necessity that he had to take that course, but for the need that we had
of such instruction; for hereby we see that Satan is conquerable, and
also how we must use our weapons.<a id="FNanchor_474_474" href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> In this also he left us ‘an
example, that we should follow his steps;’ as Gideon said to his
soldiers, ‘As you see me do, so do you likewise,’ [Judges vii. 17.] Thus,
as it were, doth our Lord speak to us: For your sakes suffered I these
temptations, that I might teach your hands to war, and your fingers to
fight; for your sakes I used these weapons of yours, rather than my
own, that I might shew you the use of your sword and shield, and how
your adversary may be overcome by them; dealing herein with us as
a master at arms,—it is Musculus’s comparison,—who, for the better
instructing and animating of his tyro, takes rather his disciple’s sword
than his own, to beat his adversary withal, minding not only the conquest
of an enemy, but also the encouragement of a young soldier.<a id="FNanchor_475_475" href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span></p>

<p>If any carry a suspicion in their mind that Christ had not our instruction
so much in his eye as hath been said, because he gives not
such particular instructions for our spiritual welfare<a id="FNanchor_476_476" href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> as the apostle in
Eph. vi., expecting that our Saviour should have been more punctual
in making particular applications from every part of his carriage to
our use, and drawing out from thence some positive conclusions or
draughts of the way and manner of resistance, they may know that
there is no other difference betwixt Eph. vi. and Mat. iv. than there
is betwixt precept and example. What the apostle there prescribed
in the theory, here Christ teacheth in the practice; here we have in
their use the girdle of truth, the shield of faith, the sword of the Spirit,
the helmet of salvation, and all the other parts of that armour; and
withal we may know that this is a far more advantageous way of teaching
young beginners, to let them see things in a plain example, than
only to give general precepts. But besides, we are to consider that
Christ did many things, the meaning whereof the disciples then present
with him did not know as yet, neither was it expected from them
that they should; like to what he said to Peter, John xiii. 7, ‘What
I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter;’ but were
intended to be laid up in store to be more fully made use of, as after-directions
should come in to give them information. He therefore
that had purposed to give further light in this matter by his apostle
and servant, was now doing that which his design led him to in his
personal actings, with a secret respect also to those instructions which
he intended after to communicate. We have then no reason to be
jealous that these temptations were not intended for our use, but the
more to assure ourselves that it was even so, because we find that those
very weapons which here Christ in his own person wielded against
Satan, are afterwards recommended to us.</p>

<p>Having thus laid the foundation, we must then, if we will imitate
our captain, carefully observe his deportment from point to point, that
we may draw out those instructions which he intended for us.</p>

<p>And the first thing that I shall take notice of, shall be the courage
and magnanimity of our leader. He had endured temptations forty
days and nights before, and yet he keeps the field without any appearance
of shrinking or running away. Satan no sooner tempts than he
is repelled. From this consideration we have this instruction:—</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> 1. <i>That he that would successfully resist temptations, must
not fly, but with a courageous resolve set himself to oppose.</i></p>

<p>Christians are apt to fear, when Satan comes up against them, and
ready to turn their backs: as the Israelites were dismayed at the
appearance of Goliath, and fled before him. But if we would conquer,
we must, as David, go out against him in ‘the name of the Lord.’
To this we are called, 1 Cor. xvi. 13, ‘Stand fast in the faith, quit
yourselves like men, be strong;’ and Eph. vi. 14, ‘Stand, having your
loins girt with truth,’ &amp;c. This courage recommended is not a contempt
and negligent slighting of danger, nor is it a bold adventurousness
upon occasions of sin; it is a holy, humble courage, and doth
admit of a threefold fear.</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>Of a fear of sin</i>, that is, a hatred of it. We must fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
sin as the greatest evil. This is no cowardice, but tends to the
strongest resolution and highest endeavours against it. From this
principle is it that men oppose sin as their mortal enemy, and excite
their utmost courage to fight against it. As the Philistines being
afraid of Israel, and yet hating to serve the Hebrews, mutually encouraged
one another, ‘Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O
ye Philistines.’ A fear of hatred begets boldness.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Courage admits <i>of a preventing fear and a provident
avoidance</i>. Occasions of sin are to be fled. We are not with greater
earnestness called upon to stand, than we are warned in this case ‘to
fly.’ So the apostle often, ‘fly fornication,’ ‘fly idolatry,’ ‘fly youthful
lusts.’ Occasions are best opposed by flying, where calling and
duty doth not engage: Prov. iv. 14, ‘Enter not into the path of the
wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.’ He fights best that flies
most, where necessity doth not bid him stay, 1 Cor. vi. 18, x. 14,
and 2 Tim. ii. 22.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, It also admits of the fear <i>of a holy jealousy</i>; such a
distrust of ourselves, as puts us to seek to ‘the rock which is higher
than we’ for shelter. God calls us to ‘turn into our stronghold,’
Nahum i. 7, and to ‘lay hold upon his strength,’ [Isa. xxvii. 5.] It
is rashness or desperateness, and not true courage, to adventure ourselves
without our guard or shield. But however we must fear sin,
suspect our strength, and fly occasions, yet Satan we must not fly.
Here we are bid to stand, for these reasons:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>It is impossible to fly from him</i>. He can follow us
wherever we go. If we go to holy assemblies, he can come thither.
If we shut up ourselves in our closets, he can meet us there. If we
betake ourselves to a wilderness or to a crowd, to be sure he will find
us out.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>We are expressly charged to make resistance</i>: James
iv. 7, ‘Resist the devil;’ 1 Peter v. 9, ‘whom resist.’ This plainly
speaks positive endeavours and opposition on our part.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>A fainting fear is an unbelieving distrust of Gods
power</i>, as if he were not ‘able to save to the uttermost,’ [Heb. vii. 25,]
and of Christ’s compassionate tenderness, as if he would not ‘succour
those that are tempted,’ [Heb. ii. 18.]</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>Our fainting makes Satan insult</i>. He triumphs
when we turn our backs, and besides hath the greater advantage to
wound us or to tread us down at pleasure. It is observed that God
provides armour for head and breast, and all the fore parts, by a shield
in case of resistance; but if we fly, so little encouragement is there for
cowardice, there is no armour for the back.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, <i>It is most suitable to Christian courage to die in the
place, and to put it to the utmost hazard rather than to yield</i>.
According to Vespasian’s motto, <i>Oportet imperatorem stantem mori</i>.
Every Christian should say, ‘Shall such a one as I fly?’ [Neh. vi.
11;] one that hath given up my name to God; one that hath
professed holiness afore men; one that hath so many advantages for
resistance, and such sweet encouragements from a victorious general!</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But the great question is, What is this fear that is forbidden,
and the courage which is enjoined?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span></p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> The fear forbidden is an unbelieving weakness and pusillanimity,
through which, as hopeless of success, men throw down their
weapons and yield themselves up to Satan, when the hearts of men
fail them to the giving up of the victory.</p>

<p>Spiritual courage, on the contrary, is a serious resolve of fighting it
out in the strength of the Lord, and it consists of these two parts:—</p>

<p><i>First, A sincere resolution to be on Christ’s side against all iniquity</i>,
a deliberate unfeigned determination to stand for God and his holy
ways, against Satan and sin. [1.] The ground of this determination
is a conviction of the evil of sin, even to a hatred of it. He that hath
not thoroughly weighed the misery of living in sin, and fully purposed
within himself to forsake it, can have no true Christian courage when
it comes to a pinch. [2.] From this ground he lays himself under
solemn engagements to Christ his general, as soldiers list themselves
under their captains, that he will follow him and observe his commands;
he gives up himself to God by covenant. So that now he is
no longer his own, but Christ’s servant, bound for his work. [3.] And
this with such or so much belief of his promises for aid and victory,
that he hath some hopes or expectations at least, that God may at
last so assist him that he may attain to some real degree of the
mortification of the ‘flesh, with the affections and lusts thereof,’ [Gal.
v. 24.]</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, The second part of this courage consists in <i>a suitable
management of this undertaking</i>. Courage is not only seen in the
first onset, but in the prosecution of the warfare; and this lies in two
things. [1.] When there are real endeavours against sin, answerable
to this undertaking, in all ways of striving to oppose it. When men
do not engage against sin with big words only; or as the children of
Ephraim—who, arming themselves and carrying bows, seemed to have
stout resolves, but then ‘turned back in the day of battle;’ but with
real and conscientious wrestlings, setting themselves with all their
might and care against every temptation, and studying to pursue the
victory, where in any degree it is obtained, to a greater height. [2.]
When these endeavours are sincerely persisted in, without being quite
wearied out or utter fainting, so that it never comes to this, though
they may be sometime under Satan’s feet, that they relinquish their
first solemn engagement, or repent of their undertaking, and then
turn their backs upon God, listing themselves under Satan’s colours.
Such a fainting as this would bereave men of their crown; ‘Ye shall
reap in due time if ye faint not,’ Gal. vi. 9. Upon this hazard are
the children of God cautioned, Heb. xii. 3, ‘Lest ye be wearied and
faint in your mind.’ [3.] There is also a particular kind of courage
expressed in a holy and humble contempt of Satan’s suggestions,
when after all means used they cease not to be troublesome. This is
not to slight sin but to slight Satan, who, though he is resisted, ceaseth
not to molest.<a id="FNanchor_477_477" href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p><i>Applic.</i> I shall particularly apply this first direction, [1.] To
those that propound ease to themselves in their race or warfare, which
is a thing impossible to one that doth the work of a soldier, not considering
that work and courageous endeavours do abide them. [2.]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
To those that pretend themselves Christ’s soldiers, courage and Christian
magnanimity is your cognizance. By this must you be known.
How do ye stand? what are your resolutions and undertakings?
Those Christians that have ‘joy and peace in believing’ can more
easily satisfy themselves in this; but those that fight in tears and
grief, in disquiets and troubled thoughts, are apt to conclude themselves
unbelieving, because they are fearful; or to think that they
look not up to Jesus, the ‘author and finisher of their faith,’ because
they apprehend themselves weary and ‘faint in their minds.’ For the
ease and help of such, I shall shew in a few things that there is as
real a Christian courage in such mourners as in some that sing songs
of triumph.</p>

<p>[1.] First, It is a real courage and undertaking against sin for any
to resolve his utmost, <i>out of detestation of it, before he can satisfy
himself that God will accept of it</i>. To oppose sin under such a discouragement,
or at such a venture, is a courageous hatred; and yet
so do these mourners.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>To be under continual grievings because of miscarriages,
so that other things of outward enjoyment cease to be pleasing</i>,
is a courageous hatred; but this is their case.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>To wrestle against sin under high discouragements</i>,
when afflicted and tossed, when Satan runs upon them and shakes
them by the neck, and yet they continue their wrestling and withstanding
as they are able; this is faithful resistance, ‘a resistance
unto blood, striving against sin,’ Heb. xii. 4; that is, if that expression
be proverbial, like that, <i>ad sanguinem usque</i>, they resist sin faithfully,
under great hazards and inconveniencies, even to wounds and
blood, till they have broken heads and broken faces; and can say to
God, though we have been ‘broken in the place of dragons,’ and have
these wounds to shew, yet ‘have we not departed from thee,’ [Ps.
xliv. 19,] nor quitted our desires after thee and holiness, for all
these buffetings of Satan; but this is the character of these dejected
ones.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, It is a courageous hatred that cannot <i>suffer a sinful
motion to fall upon the soul, but it puts all into a combustion within,
and raiseth disquiet</i>; for it is an argument that there is a contrariety
betwixt the heart and sin; but this is their case also.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, It is courage and constancy <i>to hold on in gracious
endeavours and strivings</i>; so that when they fall, as soon as they can
re-collect their strength they set on where they left, and renew the
battle, never changing their first resolve for holiness against sin. This
is implied in the apostle’s phrase of ‘standing,’—Eph. vi., ‘That ye
may withstand, and when ye have done all, to stand.’ He is accounted
to stand that runs not out of the field, but stands to his holy resolve
to the last, though the battle go sore against him by fits; but such are
these mourners.</p>

<p>There is true courage under mourning and disquiet of heart, so that
we may say to such, ‘O thou afflicted and tossed,’ fear not, ‘the glory
of the Lord shall shine upon thee,’ [Isa. lx. 1.] They that are weak
in this sense shall be strong as David.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIII_3">CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The second direction, that temptations are not to be disputed.—The
several ways of disputing a temptation.—In what cases it is convenient
and necessary to dispute with Satan.—In what cases inconvenient,
and the reasons of it.</i></p>


<p>The next thing observable in Christ’s carriage to Satan is this, that
Christ, though he rejected every temptation by giving a reason of his
refusal from the command of God, did not suffer Satan to dispute his
temptations further than the first proposal, and in his answers he
takes no notice of the reasons or motives by which he laboured to
make his temptations prevailing. In the two first temptations he
gives no reply to what Satan insinuated by his supposition, ‘If thou
be the Son of God,’ neither by affirming that he was so, nor discovering
to him his knowledge of the secret subtlety which he had wrapped
up under these plausible pretences. In the third he answers not a
word to the vanity and falsehood of his deceitful offer of ‘the kingdoms
of the world,’ though, as hath been observed, he might have
opposed strong reasons against them all; and besides, when Satan
became insolent and impudent in tempting Christ ‘to fall down and
worship him,’ he chaseth him away with a severe abomination, ‘Get
thee hence, Satan;’ from which we have a second direction, which is
this:—</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> 2. <i>That temptations to sin are to be opposed by peremptory
denials rather than by disputings.</i></p>

<p>This is a note which most commentators have on this place; but it
stands in need of a distinct application, because it is not a rule so general
but that the practice of God’s children have made exception against
it. For the clearer explanation of it, I shall,</p>

<p>1. First, <i>Give you the several kinds of disputings, by which we may
see that all are not alike</i>; for,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>The serious working of the thoughts in a quick denial of
a temptation with a reason implied or expressed, though it admit not
Satan to any further dispute or argument, may in some sense be called
a disputing</i>; for the Scripture useth διαλογισμὸς for any inward,
serious thought. Such a kind of disputing as this is necessary. It
cannot be wanting to any that refuse a sinful motion, this being, as
we shall see afterward, one of those directions which Christ intended
us by his example, and the very thing which Christ practised in every
temptation; for he contented not himself to give a naked denial, but
still adds a reason of such refusal. Those who in general terms urge
that temptations are not to be disputed, do not reckon this as any disputing;
and others that do, taking disputing for the refusal of a thing
with a reason assigned, think that his procedure in the two first
temptations is not imitable by us, but only that of the third, wherein
he chased away the devil with angry denial; but the mistake is
obvious.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>There is a disputing of unnecessary curiosity and
conference</i>. This is when a sinful motion injected into our hearts is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
not directly consented to, but then instead of a full denial men begin
to raise questions and make objections of lesser moment, or some impertinent
queries which strike not at the root; as one observed of himself,
that instead of denying a sinful motion, he began to dispute
whether it came from Satan or his own inclination; and so, instead of
quenching the fire, he busied himself to inquire whence it came. Men
deal with temptations in this case as they who being asked whether
they will buy such a commodity, hastily answer no, but yet call back
the party again and ask whence it came, or what it must cost, and by
such entanglements of curiosity engage themselves at last to buy it.
Eve failed by such an inconsiderate conference with Satan, for the
abrupt beginning of the serpent’s speech, ‘Yea, hath God said ye shall
not eat,’ &amp;c., and the summing up of the arguments which prevailed
with her to eat, ‘When the woman saw that the tree was good for
food, and pleasant to the eyes,’ &amp;c., [Gen. iii. 6,] do clearly evidence
that there was more discourse than is there expressed, and that also
tending to ascertain the goodness, pleasantness, and profit of the fruit.
This kind of disputing is always unlawful and dangerous, for it is but
a wanton dalliance with a temptation, a playing upon the hole of the
asp, and commonly ends in a sinful compliance.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>There is a disputing of a deliberating and parleying
indifferency</i>. This is when the devil puts a thought of sin into their
minds, and, while they seem not to be forward to embrace it, leaves it
to further consideration, and then they float betwixt resolved and unresolved,
betwixt <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, being at a great dispute within themselves
what is best to be done, whether the conveniences on the one
hand will weigh down the inconveniences on the other. This, in
cases of apparent sin, is a wicked halting betwixt two, always unlawful.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>There are also treacherous partial arguings, wherein
the heart takes part with Satan</i>. These are those debates that are to
be found in natural men, about the doing or not doing of sinful things.
This looks so like the combat betwixt the flesh and the Spirit, that it
hath occasioned an inquiry how they may be distinguished each from
other. It is generally concluded that in that strife of the natural man,
the light of the understanding and conscience gives opposition to the
bent of the affections, and the same faculties, though sanctified in
part in the regenerate, are the parties that give opposition each to
other; but with this principal difference, that in this strife of the flesh
and Spirit the man takes part with God, whereas in the other the affections
take the devil’s part, and in a malignant averseness to the light,
strive to put it out and to get over the conviction of conscience, so that
the man strives to sin, and to stop the mouth of such objections as
come in to the contrary; this kind of disputing is always sinful.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, <i>There is yet a disputing in a strict sense, which is a
full and solemn debating of a satanical injection, by giving it the full
hearing, and admitting Satan to be a respondent to our objections</i>.
Of this it is queried how far it may be convenient and how far inconvenient,
because we see Christ in this place did not thus dispute with
Satan, and yet we find instances in Scripture of some holy men that
have been unavoidably engaged to dispute a temptation to the utmost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span></p>

<p>To answer this query, I shall, secondly, shew in what cases it may be
necessary or convenient to enter the lists with Satan in a holy arguing,
and in what cases it is inconvenient and dangerous. There are four
cases in which we may dispute a temptation:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, When the motion is of things <i>doubtful and disputable,
whether they be lawful or not</i>. Here it cannot be avoided; for albeit,
as the apostle adviseth, Rom. xiv. 1, ‘doubtful disputations’ are not
to be imposed upon others, so as to tie them up to our persuasions,
yet in these things every man, before he can act clearly, is to endeavour
his own satisfaction in the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the thing,
that so he may be ‘fully persuaded in his own mind,’ ver. 5. And
he gives two strong reasons of this, ver. 22, 23: (1.) From the rack
and trouble which otherwise the man may be put upon, while his
conscience, unsatisfied, ‘condemneth him in that which,’ by a contrary
practice, ‘he alloweth.’ (2.) In that this condemnation of conscience,
while he doth that, the lawfulness whereof he believeth not, is an evidence
of his sin, as well as an occasion of his trouble.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Disputings have place, when <i>a temptation hath taken
hold upon the thoughts, and so far possessed itself that our corruption
riseth up in the defence of the suggestion</i>. Satan will not quit that
hold, though he be an intruder without our leave, till he be beat out
of his quarters. The apostle, Eph. vi. 16, implies so much by that expression,
of ‘quenching the fiery darts’ of Satan. It is not proper to
understand it of a refusal of the first motion of sin—though interpreters
do usually make it comprehensive both of the keeping out of the dart,
and the plucking it out—because this evidently supposeth that the
dart hath pierced the soul, and now begins to burn and inflame, which
will require more labour for the quenching of it, than a refusal of the
first motion would put us to. As when fire hath taken hold upon our
houses, we shall be forced to bring water for the extinguishing of the
flame, which before it had broke out upon the building, an ordinary
care might have prevented. And this we [are] further taught by a
distinction which the same apostle useth in the same place, of στῆναι
and ἀντιστῆναι, standing and withstanding. We must keep off the
temptation, that it enter not, by standing against the assault in
a peremptory refusal; but if it do enter, then we must be put to
it, by a force of holy arguing, to pull out the arrow, and to withstand
it.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Much more need have we of disputing, when the
present temptation is <i>a motion of such a sin which we are habituated
unto, and have long practised</i>; for these kind of sinful motions are
not cast out easily. In this case, David adviseth his enemies, Ps. iv.
2-4, who had for a long time, ‘loved vanity, and sought after leasing,’
that by ‘communing with their own heart,’ and by disputing against
their sinful practices, they should bring themselves under a holy awe,
and by that means stop the course of their sinning, ver. 4. This,
indeed, is the great thing that sinners are called to by God, to ponder
their estate, to consider their ways, to study the evil and danger of
sin, to examine themselves, and to reason together with God about
the wickedness and ingratitude of their actions, and about the contrary
loveliness, blessedness, and happiness of the ways of God, that so they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
may be brought to repentance; all which are done only by a serious
arguing of their case and hazard.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, It is convenient, and in some cases necessary, to
dispute a temptation which Satan offers to us, <i>by the mouths of men,
who entice us to share with them in their wickedness</i>; for here, by
arguing, we may not only discourage their further solicitation, and so
free ourselves from the like temptation for the future, but we also,
by the exercise of a holy charity, endeavour to ‘pull them out of the
fire,’ Jude 23. When Joseph’s mistress tempted him, he considered
that he had to deal both with the devil and his mistress, Gen. xxxix.
7, 8, and therefore that he might ‘resist the devil,’ he peremptorily
refused the temptation; but that he might take off his mistress from
her unlawful prosecution, he argues with her about the ingratitude,
danger, and unlawfulness of such an act, ‘My master wotteth not what
is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to
my hand: there is none greater in this house than I, neither hath he
kept anything back from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how
then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?’ When
sinners do entice us to cast in our lot amongst them, pity to them,
and care of ourselves, will engage us to argue the folly and danger of
their ways with them, except they behave themselves as dogs and
swine; their carriage giving us just ground to conclude, that they are
so set on wickedness, that it may endanger us, rather than profit them,
to debate with them. And so was it likely—and the text seems to
hint so much—that when Joseph perceived his mistress was resolved
upon the pursuit, and that his reasonings were not minded, he persisted
in his denial, but forbore his arguings.</p>

<p>But however it may be convenient to dispute, in the last mentioned
sense, in these four cases—and others may probably be added—yet
there are cases in which it will be inconvenient and hazardous to dispute
or argue, and of this order I shall reckon four.</p>

<p>[1.] First, It is not safe to dispute the matter in <i>vile, infectious
temptations, such as are either suitable to our inclinations, or may
receive a favourable aspect and countenance from the posture of our
affairs and condition</i>. These temptations, even in our debating
against them, are like the opening of a sepulchre, which sends forth a
poisonous stream<a id="FNanchor_478_478" href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> which may infect those that loathe and resist it. It
is dangerous to admit fire into the same room where there is gunpowder,
though there be no intention to kindle it. It hath been
an old observation, that the very confession of infectious sins, though
designed to beget shame, and resolution against them for the future,
have kindled a new flame, by the unnecessary declaration of the manner
and circumstances, so that they have returned from the confessor more
infected than when they went; and those very persons whose care it
should have been to have put the highest disgrace upon sins so confessed,
to the begetting of loathing and abhorrency in the parties and
themselves, have by too curious an inquiry received such poison at the
ear, that the heart hath been forthwith infected. The like hazard
remains to those that are willing to debate such sins with Satan; for
though they begin upon the score of resistance, yet the very dwelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
on such a subject, when admitted to lay itself open, doth convey such
amorous looks unto the treacherous affections, that the heart is in
danger of a secret poison. There is no better way in such cases than
to command all such thoughts and considerations out of our coasts,
and, as we do when the city or town we live in is infected, to withdraw
ourselves from the air of such a temptation. We may observe
the like care in Joseph, though he thought himself concerned at first,
as hath been said, to oppose the unlawful suit of his mistress, yet seeing
her desperately set upon her folly, he declined all communication
with her, and would not be with her, Gen. xxxix. 10; and at last,
when she caught him by his garment, ‘he left it in her hand and
fled,’ ver. 12. He might easily have rescued his garment from her,
had he not been aware that his contesting against her might have
been an occasion of ensnarement to himself. Christ himself, when he
was tempted by Peter to spare himself, [Mat. xvi. 22,]—which was a
temptation very taking to human nature, especially when suffering
and death is in view,—is more short and sparing in his reasoning
against it, than he was when the devil tempted him. He gives no
positive reasons against it, as he did when he was tempted to ‘fall
down and worship the devil,’ but dischargeth himself from any further
consideration of the matter by a declared abhorrency of the thing, ‘Get
thee behind me, Satan, for thou savourest not the things that be of
God, but the things which be of men.’ Which is as if he had plainly
said, This is so apparently from the devil, and so much abhorred by
me, because so suitable to my condition, that I will not so much as
discourse of it or consider it.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, Generally in all temptations, though they have not
the advantage of our present special estate or inclination, as hath been
noted, <i>of an apparent withdrawment from obedience, or of things unquestionably
sinful, it is not convenient to dispute them, but to dismiss
them by a denial, except some of the forementioned considerations do
alter the case</i>. In known cases we need not parley, but stoutly deny.
Our resolutions for duty, and against sin, should not be to seek. We
are certain that sin is to be avoided, and duty to be practised; here
we should be peremptory. Abraham being certain of duty, when God
called him to ‘a place which he should afterward receive for an inheritance,’
he disputed not the uncertainty, the danger or inconvenience
that possibly might attend his removal, but went out, ‘not knowing
whither he went,’ Heb. xi. 8. Paul being called by God to preach
among the heathen, though ‘flesh and blood’ were ready with arguments
against it, yet he would not so much as confer with them, but
immediately obeyed, Gal. i. 16. Like instances I might fetch from
other holy men. Cyprian, when the president gave it to his own
choice whether he would obey or be put to death, commanding him
to take it into consideration, he readily replied, <i>In re tam sancta non
est deliberandum</i>, that it was not to deliberate in so plain a case. Mrs
Ann Askew, when at the stake ready to be burnt, a pardon was offered
by the Lord Chancellor; she would not so much as look on it, but
returned this answer, that she came not thither ‘to deny her Lord
and Master.’ Bishop Hooker,<a id="FNanchor_479_479" href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> in the same condition, had a box laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
before him with a pardon in it, which when he understood—he was
so afraid of tampering with a temptation—he cried out, ‘If ye love
my soul, away with it; if ye love my soul, away with it.’ And many
others there were in all ages, so far from accepting such ‘unlawful
deliverances,’ that they would not take into consideration the unrighteous
terms upon which they might have escaped.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>When a temptation, after all means used, continues to
be troublesome, and is rather an annoyance than an infection, then
must we not dispute it, but by a holy contempt despise it</i>. Temptations
to blasphemy are oft of this nature, as hath been noted in its
place, and there are other things by which Satan creates to God’s
children great disquiet, while they in the meantime abhor the sin,
and cry out of the trial. Here when the ‘messenger of Satan’ will
not depart, it is an advice that hath the general approbation of holy
experienced men,<a id="FNanchor_480_480" href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> that we should despise the temptation, as an approved
way to our quiet and ease; for while we think to repel such
assaults by struggling with arguments, we do but increase the force
of them; as he that thinks to shelter himself against the wind, by
holding up his cloak before him, doth but derive upon himself a
stronger blast.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>In temptations of inward trouble and terror, it is not
convenient to dispute the matter with Satan</i>. David in Ps. xlii. 11,
seems to correct himself for his mistake; his soul was ‘cast down
within him,’ and for the cure of that temptation, he had prepared
himself by arguments for a dispute; but perceiving himself in a wrong
course, he calls off his soul from, disquiet to an immediate application
to God and the promises, ‘Trust still in God, for I shall yet praise
him;’ but in Ps. xi. 1, he is more aforehand with his work, for while
his enemies were acted by Satan to discourage him, he rejects the
temptation at first, before it settled upon his thoughts, and chaseth it
away as a thing that he would not give ear to: ‘In thee, Lord, do I
put my trust; how say ye then to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?’
And there are weighty reasons that should dissuade us from
entering the lists with Satan in temptations of inward trouble. As,</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>The determination of the sincerity of the soul and its
converted state is a question of no small difficulty</i>—a knotty controversy,
more intricate and abstruse than those controversies that in the
schools are of greatest name for difficulty; for this is liable to more
weighty objections, and stands in need of nicer distinction. As Dr
Goodwin observes,<a id="FNanchor_481_481" href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> ‘They that converse with dejected spirits, find so
much quickness and nimbleness of reasoning, turning every way to
ward off the force of an argument brought for their consolation, that
even wise and able heads are oft put to a stand, and know not what
to answer.’ Would it then be fit to give Satan this advantage? or to
admit him so far into our reasoning? He that will invite Satan to
such a contest, shall be sure to have his hands full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span></p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, This kind of temptation doth usually <i>disable men
for arguing</i>; it oftentimes confounds the brain, stupifies the understanding,
and weakens the memory. Heman complains of himself as
‘distracted by terrors,’ [Ps. lxxxviii. 15.] Job calls himself desperate,
[chap. vi. 26.] Such persons are not surely in a fit case to manage a
temptation with so cunning a sophister as Satan.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, If they descend into the battle, he is not only <i>too strong
for them, but commonly after a while they take Satan’s part against
themselves, and comply with him, concluding against their own peace</i>.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, <i>There is also a better way at hand than to enter into
a dispute</i>; and that is, by going to God by a present faith, love or
repentance, when the truth of any of these is questioned. It is a
difficult task to prove sometime that former acts of faith, love, or
other graces were sincere. This may admit of such objections from a
wounded spirit, that it will be hard to answer them; but in this case
it is a nearer way to see if there be not in all these complainings
some present acts of these graces; whether such complainants are not
willing to embrace Christ upon any terms, whether they do not hate
sin, whether they would not unfeignedly be reconciled to God, &amp;c. It
oft falls out that this doth stay the trouble when examinations of
former acts do nothing for them. Some men are at more pains, as
one saith, to repair and fit an old building, than would serve to rear a
new one. Yet must it be remembered that though it were the best
course to resist temptations of this nature at first, by avoiding unnecessary
disputings, notwithstanding when this—as I noted before of
other temptations—hath seized upon the heart and taken possession,
then shall we be forced to ‘fill our mouths with arguments,’ and whether
we will or no, must we undergo a contest. As we see in David,
who when his troubles had prevailed upon him, was forced to plead
with God, with himself, with the temptation, and to have recourse to
former experience, ‘the days of old, and the years of the right hand
of the Most High,’ [Ps. lxxvii. 10,] and all little enough.</p>

<p>All that I shall further say concerning the inconveniences of disputing
with Satan, shall be to give you <i>the reasons manifesting these
unnecessary communings with him to be every way hazardous and
unsuitable</i>. As,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>It is an honour to Satan, and a disgrace to ourselves</i>.
Men are loath to be seen contesting with persons of a far inferior
rank, especially in such things which have procured to such a noted
infamy. It is a usual piece of generosity in men of spirit that they
scorn to strive with a scold, or contend with a beggar, or be found
in company of those that are under an evil name deservedly; and in
matters that are vile and base, it is highly disgraceful to admit them
to a debate. Such things will either get more credit than they
deserve, while they seem to be countenanced by a dispute, or else shall
communicate their discredit to those that shall shew such familiarity
with them.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>By refusing to dispute temptations, we raise up in
our hearts an active abhorrency of them, and by that abhorrency we are
cautioned and strengthened against them</i>. It must needs awaken our
hatred into a present activity against that sin, which our consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
at first view presents to us so abominable, that it deserves no other
answer but to be whipped out of our sight. And when our heart
is thus alarmed, it cannot but stand upon its guard. It is a course
that holy men have taken to keep men at a greater distance from sin,
to present it as a thing of greatest abhorrency; and that is the intendment
of that expression, Rom. vi. 1, ‘Shall we sin, that grace may
abound? God forbid,’ The vileness of that abuse of gospel grace he
shews by setting it below the merit of any serious thought; he sharpens
their apprehensions against it by an outcry of detestation. The like
he doth, Eph. v. 3, where he endeavours to set their hearts against
uncleanness and coveteousness, by telling them that it was unbecoming
saintship that such things should be ‘so much as once named by
them.’</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>Disputing is a secret invitation to the devil to urge the
temptation further</i>. We do but toy with him, and give him occasion
to follow us. Eve found the truth of this by sad experience; she
so managed herself, that she plainly intimated she had a mind to hear
what the devil could say for the eating of the forbidden fruit; and so
urged the prohibition of God, and the threatening, that she sought
from Satan a confirmation of her secret unbelief rather than faithfully
endeavoured a repulse of the temptation, and mentioned the threatening
under such terms of uncertainty and peradventure, as an objection
which she desired might be removed, rather than from a firm belief of
that death spoken of, fortifying herself in her duty; by all which
Satan was so encouraged to proceed, that he presently confirmed her
in her distrust.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>These disputings usually return nothing of advantage
to our account, but to Satan’s</i>. We unnecessarily enter the lists
with him, and that upon very unequal terms, he being, as Saul said
of Goliath and David, a ‘man of war from his youth,’ and we but
weak, unskilful striplings. We go out of our trenches and leave our
weapons behind us. We expose our naked breasts to all his darts,
and by discoursing with him he gains time wherein the poison may
more powerfully work upon our affections. If he was too hard for our
first parents at this weapon, we, whose hearts are not so faithful to
God as theirs in innocency, but corrupted by Satan, who hath also
a party in us, are not likely to come off with triumph.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, <i>These presage, consequently, an overthrow</i>. A parleying
city holds not long out. It implies in itself an inclination to yield,
when armies are willing to treat. Daily examples and experience of
those that give up themselves to sin after communication with Satan
sadly witness this truth.</p>

<p>The sum of this direction is this, that when a motion of sin is put
into our heart, instead of disputing where it may be avoided, we should
peremptorily deny it and send it away with an angry rebuke or severe
abomination: I may not do it; How can I do this wickedness? Get
thee hence; or, ‘The Lord rebuke thee, Satan.’</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span></p>




<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIV_3">CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The third direction, of repelling a temptation without delay.—The
necessity of so doing.—What a speedy denial doth contain.</i></p>


<p>The magnanimity of Christ, and the peremptoriness of his denial,
we have noted. We must further observe the immediateness of his
answer; he suffered not any of these motions to stay long with him;
here was not a <i>Cras tibi respondebo</i>, Come again to-morrow and I will
answer. He would not take time with the devil, but had his answer
ready. No sooner was he tempted, but the temptation was repelled;
for these expressions—‘But he answered and said;’ ‘Jesus said
unto him;’ ‘Then saith Jesus unto him,’—shew the quickness and
speediness of these returns, that he answered presently, forthwith.
Hence we have a third direction in our resisting of Satan, which
is this:—</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> 3. <i>Temptations are best answered when they are presently
denied and forthwith repelled.</i> The direction is of great importance;
it is not for us to pass by a temptation with silence, or to defer an
answer. For these reasons:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, The nature of temptations, <i>as dangerous or infectious,
doth sufficiently enforce a necessity of their speedy removal</i>. Things
of danger require a sudden stop. If poison be taken into the body, we
speedily labour to cast it up, or to overcome it by antidotes. We
labour to stay the spreading of a gangrene presently. Who thinks it fit
to delay when fire hath taken hold upon a house? The very opportunity
of help is in the speediness of the endeavour. It is too late
to bring water when the house is consumed, too late to apply a remedy
when the disease hath conquered. They that consider what a temptation
is, will see no reason to move slowly in opposing.<a id="FNanchor_482_482" href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>Silence encourageth Satan</i>. It is not with him as it
is with men; it is the policy of some to overlook their petitioners, and
by silence to scare them from any further address; but Satan hath
more impudence than to be put out of countenance by delay, and
more active malice than to be discouraged by silence; nay, it doth on
the contrary embolden him. Modest requests are disheartened by
silence, but such motions which, by their nature, imply a disgrace,
and carry no reason for their acceptance but what they expect to find
in the consent of those to whom they are made, if they be not presently
refused, they give encouragement to hope for entertainment. An
immodest request to a chaste matron, if not forthwith expressly
abominated, encourageth to further attempts. Sin being so great an
affront to a holy heart, the motion of it cannot be entertained with
silence, but Satan is emboldened to expect consent in time, and follows
his advantage accordingly. He usually flies at a valiant peremptory
resistance; but if the pulse of the soul beat slowly upon the motion,
he grounds his hope upon that, and is animated to a further procedure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span></p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, <i>Our wills are apt to be inclined by delay</i>. Though
grace have made straight our crooked natures, yet we still carry such
a sway to our former dispositions, that a small thing, having the advantage
of our natural bias and inclination, makes us, like a deceitful
bow, turn to our old stand. For the understanding and will of the
regenerate are but imperfectly good, the faculties that should obey
are unruly. In such a case how dangerous may delays prove! Who
will suffer a seditious incendiary in an army, formerly inclined to
mutiny? Who will permit leaven to remain in that mass, which he
desires may not be leavened, and not quickly remove it? Who will
neglect a spark upon dry tinder, that would not have it consumed,
and not instantly put it out? If it was so great a mischief to Eve in
innocency, as hath been said, to delay her peremptory denial, of how
much greater hazard is it to us! Delays are dangerous to a very
proverb, and silence may end in consent.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, <i>Silence is also some degree of consent</i>. It is strange
to find a man delaying an answer to temptation, and yet no way guilty
of consenting. In things that are to be opposed with care and hatred,
no man can withhold his hand without blame. He that is not against
Satan, who is to be perpetually resisted, is so far for him as he is not
against him. He that delays justice which is due, denies it. The
judge in the parable was called unjust, not because he had devoured
the widow’s house, but because he deferred to do her right.<a id="FNanchor_483_483" href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> He that
hinders not evil when and as soon as he can, doth command and
approve it. These are received axioms amongst men, and have the
same truth in them if applied to resistance of temptations. And this
may further appear by considering, [1.] The weakness of the will in
the regenerate. When our wills are really set upon good and against
evil, yet we cannot say they are perfectly for the one and against the
other, but that there is still some degree of averseness to good, and of
inclination to evil in our wills, or else we should not meet with complainings
of imperfections under sincere resistances; as in the apostle,
‘The evil that I would not, that do I,’ [Rom. vii. 19.] [2.] The acts
of the will in consenting may be so sudden, short, and quick, that
they may be almost insensible, and as forward and ready as the
motion. [3.] The will may be interpretatively voluntary and consenting,
when yet it forms not in itself any positive approbation. It
may be guilty, in that it doth not more strongly and speedily dissent:
for the suspension or negation of the will’s act, where it ought to act,
cannot avoid the charge of coming short of duty.</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, Not to answer presently, <i>is to lose the best opportunity
of answering</i>. It is less dangerous, more easy, more comfortable to
be speedy in denial. The sooner fire is put out, or the disease is
stayed, the less hurt is done; and it is far less labour to quench a
spark than a flame; to pluck up a young plant than an old standard;
to kill the cockatrice in the egg. A temptation opposed speedily, is
with greater ease overcome, than after it hath settled though but a
little: for it presently makes a party within us; our affections are
soon engaged, our understanding soon bribed, and then we have not
only Satan but ourselves to oppose; and this self so divided, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
when we come to fight, our wills are against our wills, our affections
against our affections, our wishes and prayers clash and contradict
each other. As Austin confesseth of himself: ‘I prayed,’ said he,
‘and then feared lest thou shouldst hear me too soon; I desired to
satisfy, rather than to extinguish lust.’<a id="FNanchor_484_484" href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> At the first assault the soul
is oft in a better posture, more unanimous and consistent with itself;
then is the golden opportunity of resistance. For, as one saith,<a id="FNanchor_485_485" href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> it is
better to do it while reason is on our side, than when both reason and
affection conspire against us. And, lastly, it would be more honour
and satisfaction to us, rather not to have admitted such a guest, than
after such admittance into our thoughts to be forced to cast him out.<a id="FNanchor_486_486" href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">486</a>
In the review of our actions we shall have more comfort to have been
resolute against any sin than to hold our peace.</p>

<p>The necessity of a quick and speedy rejection of a sinful motion is
then beyond dispute, and there needs no more to be said for the explanation
of this direction, but an account of what is implied in a
speedy denial. It contains these four things:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, <i>That it must issue from a fixed determination against
sin</i>. Some refuse a temptation with the same mind that carried
Lot’s wife out of Sodom, and are forced beyond their own inclination,
but these go not far till they ‘look back;’ and no wonder: for if he
that is sincerely peremptory against sin at the first motion, may by
the solicitation of the flesh be inclined afterward, there is little expectation
that he whom the first motion finds indifferent and but
coldly denying, should hold out long. But that refusal that must
give any encouragement to hopes of success, must be an answer of
holy indignation against the offer of temptation, and that confirmed
into a serious resolve of heart not to yield.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>This positive denial must be also wisely jealous of
Satan, in motions that are unlikely, or that may seem light, little, and
not directly intended</i>. Though it may be but a transient glance, or a
thing that is out of our road, yet must nothing be contemned or
undervalued. Jealousy will take notice of small actions or circumstances,
and no less suspicious must we be of every proffer made to us,
lest Satan by any means get an advantage against us.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>The refusal must be so quick, that it may be ready to
take the temptation by the throat</i>. At the first motion or rising of it
in our mind, we must endeavour to stifle it in the birth, that it may
be as the ‘untimely fruit of a woman that never sees the sun,’ [Job
iii. 16;] we must not give it time to grow up to a rod of wickedness,
but must nip it in the earliest buddings of it. It is the nature of
grace, if we do but faithfully pursue the inclinations of it, to be quick
in its opposition. So doth the apostle’s phrase teach us, Gal. v. 17,
‘The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh:’
the spirit is as ready to repel, as the flesh to suggest. No sooner doth
the one stir, but the other is ready with an opposition, and the reason
of it is from the active contrariety that is betwixt them; for so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
word, ἀντίκειται, there used, would express it; they are sworn enemies,
animated by principles of constant opposition, as water and fire are,
which cannot meet in peace together, but a present noise and combat
is raised from this conjunction.</p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, When this is done, <i>we must endeavour to maintain
and stick to our first disallowance</i>. A child of God, I know, in sinful
yieldings of infirmity, may say as the apostle, ‘What I do, I allow
not,’—that is, [1.] What he then consents to, he did not allow at the
first, till importunity prevailed. [2.] Though his affections incline to
sin, yet his constant settled judgment is against it; and though he do
it, he cannot say he approves it. Neither of these are the things I
aim at; but this, that as the first motions of sins are disallowed, we
should endeavour to keep at that, to stand our ground, to withhold the
least after-delight or approbation. Not but that we must be forced
sadly to acknowledge the real truth of what the apostle speaks in the
place last cited, that these different principles, which of them soever
carry the victory, do so impede one another, that when grace carries
it, yet it cannot do the utmost it would or aims at; so that in the
stoutest oppositions, there may be some secret degrees of allowance
unavoidably; notwithstanding we must so manage our denial, that, if
it were possible, we should not afford the smallest inclination toward
it; the least, the better and nobler conquest.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXV_3">CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The fourth direction, of repelling a temptation by Scripture arguments.—Of
several things implied in the direction.—The necessity of
answering by Scripture arguments.—The excellency of the remedy.—How
Scripture arguments are to be managed.</i></p>


<p>The next particular in Christ’s answers to be observed by us is his
citations of Scripture as an invincible reason against all the devil’s
temptations; he beats them all back with this weapon, ‘It is written.’
That this was written for our learning, and that, otherwise than for
our instruction, he lay not under any necessity of using this method,
hath been evidenced before, and it is a thing which all commentators<a id="FNanchor_487_487" href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">487</a>
do take notice of. From this we have another direction for the right
way and order of resisting temptations, which is,</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> 4. <i>That temptations are best repelled by arguments drawn
from the word of God.</i></p>

<p>For the explanation of this, it may be considered what is first
<i>presupposed in this direction</i>; for when it is affirmed that we must
answer by reasons from Scripture, this implies—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>That temptations are not to be opposed by groundless
refusals</i>. It is no way safe to say we will not, because we will not,
nor to insist upon our own bare resolve; for this would be wilfulness,
rather than an obediential refusal, and unwarrantable self-confidence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
rather than a humble wrestling. There are some, of whom it may
be said, as the prophet once charged the Jews, Isa. xxii. 11, that when
Satan comes up against them, they look in that day ‘to the armour of
the house of the forest,’ they ‘repair the wall,’ and ‘cast ditches for
fortification;’ they prepare themselves to the battle ‘in their own
strength, but they look not unto the maker thereof,’ to him who by
his mighty power must fashion our hearts to resistance. The vanity
of such undertakings is enough manifested in the event, for commonly
such men go on in a bravado of resolution, but are so altered at the
first appearance of the enemy, that they yield without a stroke. Who
could be more confident than Peter that he would not deny his Master,
whatever others did? and yet how soon did his heart fail him. We
may warrantably deny a sinful motion, without being explicit in our
reason against it, especially in usual temptations, and when they thrust
themselves into our minds at such times when our thoughts are charged
with an attendance upon other duties, in which nevertheless the heart
hath a secret and implicit regard to the command of God; but in no
case must we go down to the battle in the strength of a wilfulness,
lest it go against us. And thus do they who, when they are reproved
for some miscarriage, as of drinking, will presently with great confidence
make engagements not to drink wine or strong drink, not
to go into a tavern or alehouse, without any humble respect to duty,
or the power of God for the conquest of the sin; and accordingly
we see that usually such promises and obligations do not hold;
either they wilfully break them, or they become sinfully witty to
make evasions for the practice of sin, without the breach of the oath
or promise.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, The direction supposeth that <i>we must deny the sin
with the arguments of greatest strength and authority</i>. There were
occasions and hints of other answers to these temptations that offered
themselves in Christ’s way, and yet he waives them all, fixing only upon
Scripture reasons as the best and strongest. It is no Christian wisdom
to urge those inferior considerations of shame, loss, inconvenience, &amp;c.
Some have no other reason betwixt them and sin, but <i>What will men
say?</i> or <i>What will become of me?</i> But besides that, these would only
be a train to bring on disputings, and that it is no way safe to venture
our souls upon such defences, when better may be had; for who will
venture his life upon a staff when he may have a sword? It is easy for
Satan to break these bows, and to cut these spears in sunder. He
can balance such reasons with equal reasons, and presently make us
believe that we have as good reason to commit the sin as those urged
by us for the not committing of it.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, This direction of using Scripture reason doth clearly
imply that <i>the force and power of Scripture is not in the words or characters,
but in the mind and reason of it</i>; not that Scripture used as a
charm or spell, as if the devil were afraid of the sound and words of it,
can beat back the devil, but it is the authority of its command which
works upon the mind the highest impressions of fear and care, and as
a strong argument prevails with us to forbear. Notwithstanding the
plainness and undeniableness of this inference, not only do ignorant
men bless themselves against the devil by repeating some phrases or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
sentences of Scripture impertinently, and such as have no direct signification
of the matter in hand betwixt Satan and them, as if the
devil could not endure to hear the <i>paternoster</i>, or durst not come
within the sound of the name Jehovah, but also papists—and of them
such as might be supposed more considerate than to be carried by such
conceits—have placed a virtue in the words and sounds of Scripture,
and therefore do they command, though under some limitations and
restrictions, the hanging of sentences of Scripture about the neck in
scrolls, for the driving away of evil spirits, though in a clear contradiction
to the reason which they give in the general against this course,
which is this, that the ‘power of Scripture is not in the figures and
characters, but in the mind and understanding of it;’ and therefore
profits as ‘pondered in the heart,’ not as ‘hung about the neck;’ and
upon as slender grounds do they place a more than ordinary virtue, in
the angelical salutation, in the seven words upon the cross, in the
triumphal title, ‘Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews,’ &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_488_488" href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> Such
kind of oppositions are but a mock to Satan. We cannot think to
‘bore the jaw of this leviathan with a thorn,’ or to come to him with
‘this bridle,’ or to ‘play with him as with a bird,’ [Job xli. 2;] he
durst allege scripture himself to Christ, and therefore it is not the
phrase or sound that affrights him.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, The direction doth imply <i>an argumentative, proper,
and fit use of Scripture commands or promises</i>. We see Christ urged
not any scripture indifferently, but he used fit words, and chose to
himself select smooth stones out of this brook to sling against this
spiritual Goliath. Every temptation had an answer that doth most
fully and properly confront it. He regarded the main of the temptation,
and suffered not himself to be diverted from that prosecution, by
engaging himself in that which might have been perplexed and controversial,
though he had a fit opportunity to reprove Satan for a
dishonest craft of representing scripture in a sense of his own making,
and so might have rejected the temptation of casting himself down,
as leaning upon a false foundation, in that God did not promise in
Ps. xci. to preserve any that should presumptuously expect a protection
while they run out of God’s ways; yet he waived this answer,
and opposed the assault by a plain scripture which chargeth the contrary
duty.</p>

<p>Secondly, Having seen what this direction doth imply in these
things that are to be removed from the sense and intendment of it, I
shall next, for ascertaining of the reality and importance of it, shew
that temptations are to be resisted by Scripture arguments, by these
two evidences:—</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>God’s recommending of the commands of Scripture for
such a purpose</i>: Deut. vi. 6, ‘These words which I command thee
this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt bind them for a sign
upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes,’
&amp;c. Whether the latter part of the command is to be understood
literally, as the Jews apprehended and practised, though some think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
otherwise, is not necessary to be asserted, seeing it is granted by all
that they were to have the commands of the law so ready in their
minds and memories, as if they had been written on their hands and
upon their foreheads. That God designed this precept for the resistance
of sin and temptation cannot be doubted, and that the advantage
which might hence arise to them was not only the information of their
minds, in point of sin and duty, is as unavoidable; for that and more
is intended by that part of the injunction, ‘These words which I
command thee, shall be in thine heart;’ but when? Besides this
information, which the knowledge of the law would afford them, and
their humble compliance with it, as just and good, which would enable
them to say, ‘Thy law, O Lord, is within my heart;’ he further enjoins
them the quick and ready remembrances of these laws, as if they were
‘frontlets between their eyes, and signs on their hands.’ It can signify
no less than this, that in so doing they would be able to resist those
motions by which Satan would seek to engage them to the violation
of these commands. Neither need we to doubt hereof, when Christ
himself hath so fully taught us, by his own example, in resisting
temptations, the particular use of the remembrance of the law. In
the New Testament the apostle is most express in this matter: Eph.
vi. 17, ‘Take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,’
where not only the use of Scripture commands and promises against
Satan’s suggestions is taught, but also the high avail and potency of
this weapon in reference to its end. It is called a sword, and in that
comparison it shews the active resistance which may be made by it;
and it is called, not a sword of flesh, for ‘the weapons of our warfare
are not carnal,’ but ‘of the Spirit,’ to shew how mighty it is in
repelling Satan.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, Another evidence of its usefulness is from <i>the success
which the children of God have had in the right management of this
weapon</i>. It is observable that while Christ answered by Scripture,
Satan was silenced, and had not what to reply to the answer, but was
forced to betake himself to a new temptation. David in many places
highly magnifies the power of the command, in the success he had by
it; Ps. xvii. 4, he shews how available it was to preserve him in his
common converse from the sinful snares laid before him, ‘Concerning
the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the
paths of the destroyer.’ In Ps. xviii. 22, 23, he tells us that he
was shielded from the sins of his inclination and love, which are
hardest to prevent, by the opposition that he gave to the motions of
them, in setting up the statutes of God against them; ‘All his judgments
were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from
me; I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
iniquity.’ In Ps. cxix. 11, he puts his <i>probatum est</i> upon the head of
this receipt, and speaks of it as his constant refuge, ‘Thy word have
I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.’ In Ps. xxxvii.
31, he speaks of it as a tried case of common experience to all the
children of God, ‘The law of God is in his heart, none of his steps
shall slide.’ I shall add to this the experience of Luther, when,
saith he, in Epistle to the Galatians, ‘the motions of the flesh do
rage, the only remedy is, to take the sword of the Spirit, that is, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
word of salvation, and to fight against them; of this I myself have
good experience; I have suffered many great passions and vehement,
but so soon as I laid hold of any place of Scripture, and stayed myself
upon it, as upon an anchor, straightway my temptations did vanish
away, which without the word had been impossible for me to endure,
though but a little space, much less to overcome.’<a id="FNanchor_489_489" href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a></p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, The excellency of this remedy will further appear
from these following reasons:—</p>

<p>[1.] First, In that it is <i>a universal remedy</i>. There can be no temptation,
either of seducement or of affrightment, but the Scripture will
afford a suitable promise or command to repel it. So that it, like the
flaming sword in the cherubim’s hand at paradise, turns every way to
guard the soul. I need not give instances of its power against sinful
motions, having done that already, and of such temptations which war
against the peace of the soul. I need but say this in the general, that
as the nature of such temptations is to disguise God, and to render
him dreadful to us, in the appearances of wrath and incompassionate
implacableness—and this Luther sets down as a certain rule—so have
we in Scripture such declarations of the mind and tender inclinations
of God, and such full and clear promises to assure us of this, and those
so adapted to every case, to every kind of hard thought which we
might take up against him, that we may find enough in them to break
all those malicious misrepresentations of Satan, and to keep up in our
mind ‘right thoughts of God;’ which if we will adhere to, not suffering
such promises to be wrested out of our hands, nor our hearts to
give way to malignant impressions of cruelty, revenge, or unmercifulness
in God, though we be cast into darkness, into the deeps, we may
find some bottom on which to fix such beginnings of hope, as may at
last grow up to a spirit of rejoicing in God our Saviour; and in this
case, when our heart and Satan dictate to us that God is our enemy,
we ought, as it were, to shut our eyes, to refuse to hearken to our own
sense and feeling, and to follow the word; but if we once give up the
word of promise, it is impossible the wound of conscience should be
healed with any other consideration.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>This remedy is comprehensive of most other remedies
against Satan’s temptations</i>. In Eph. vi., there are several other
pieces of spiritual armour recommended, and yet there is such a manifest
mutual respect betwixt this and those, that any may conclude that
however they be distinguished in their names, yet they are conjoined
in their operation. The girdle, so far as it relates to truth of judgment
and opinion, depends on the word of Scripture for information;
the shoes, which are defensive resolves to walk with a steady foot in
the ways of religion, notwithstanding the hardships that attend holiness,
are prepared to us, by the comfortable and peace-bringing promises
of the gospel; the righteousness which is our breastplate, is only set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
forth and wrought out to us by the Scripture and its ordinances; faith
which is our shield, and hope which is our helmet, they neither of
them act without the warrant and encouragement of it; and whereas
other parts of the armour are defensive, this of the Scripture is compared
to the sword, which not only defends, but also offends and beats
back the enemy. If the matter be seriously considered, all these parts
of armour are but these two, the graces of the Spirit—faith, hope,
patience in their sincere exercise, and the word of Scripture as the
instrument by and in which they shew their operations; so that all
this armour being put to use, in every particular temptation, it amounts
to no more than this we are speaking of, viz., that sinful motions are
to be rejected by a believing, sincerely resolute opposing of them, with
arguments from the word of God.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, Scripture, as it is the word and command of the great
King of heaven, hath <i>a daunting and commanding authority over the
consciences of men</i>. ‘Where the word of a king is, there is power,’
Eccles. viii. 4, and such is the majesty of a divine law, that it hath
power over the consciences of those that are yet in their sins, and can
wound, affright, constrain, and bind even the rebellious; so that so
long as they retain any of their natural impressions of a divine power,
they have some awe for his commands, which may be seen and argued,
where it would be least expected, from the enragement of the hearts
of sinners, when ‘sin by the commandment,’ accidentally, ‘becomes exceeding
sinful,’ Rom. vii. 13, 14. For as that outrageous fierceness doth
arise from the contrariety that is betwixt a carnal heart and a spiritual
law; so that contrariety would never work if the authority of that
law, having a power to restrain, and give check to the corruption
of the heart, were not some way owned by the conscience; for where
no countermanding law is owned, there can be no irritating, provoking
restraint. This it can do to the vilest of men; but of how much more
power may we imagine the word to be with good men, whose hearts
tremble at the word, when they ‘bind the law upon their heart,’ and
charge their consciences with it? It is surely ‘quick and powerful,
sharper than a two-edged sword,’ [Heb. iv. 12;] nor doth it only,
by unlovely affrightments, terrify them from sin, but by commanding
duty make the heart in love with it, so that it becomes a delightful
satisfaction to be preserved from the snare.<a id="FNanchor_490_490" href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></p>

<p>[4.] Fourthly, There is no argument that can be used against
temptations that can be more <i>afflictively discouraging to Satan</i>. Satan,
as bad as he is, cannot but believe those truths which he knows, and
he knows that there are many truths in Scripture which respect him,
as threatenings of punishment and divine vengeance; he believes these
things and trembles, James ii. 19. His unavoidable knowledge or
remembrance of these things begets horror in him, he cannot but
be under a dread of these truths. What can be supposed so to wound
him as the bringing these things to memory, by urging the command
of God against him? Dr Arrowsmith<a id="FNanchor_491_491" href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> gives two instances of this
kind, the one of Christopher Haas in Sweedland—from the epistle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
dedicatory to the five tomes of Brentius’s works—the other of Daniel
Cramer, rector of a school at Stettin in Germany; on both which the
devil made a bold attempt in a personal appearance; from the first,
demanding a catalogue of his sins in writing; from the other, demanding
a paper in which one of the students had obliged himself to Satan’s
service; they both referred him to that text of Gen. iii. 15, ‘The seed
of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent.’ And this was
retorted upon him with such a strong exercise of faith, that he presently
desisted the suit and vanished.</p>

<p>[5.] Fifthly, <i>This weapon cannot easily he wrested out of our hands</i>.
When we urge a divine prohibition against a temptation, what can he
say in answer? he cannot deny it to be the word of God, or to be true,
or that we are not obliged to it. He made none of these returns to
Christ, but, by his silence, owned that it was God’s holy command
obliging us to duty. Neither dares he stand upon these exceptions to
us, except he find our faith inclined to waver, or our minds weak and
wounded by inward troubles of spirit; and when he puts on a boldness
to deny Scripture to be the word of God, or that it signifies God’s
real intendments in his threatening—for by begetting unbelief of the
truth of Scripture, and by suggesting hopes of escape and pardon,
notwithstanding the violation of the commands of it, he wrests, when
he doth prevail, this weapon out of our hands—yet he is forced to
fetch a compass, and by many previous insinuations to make his way
to these atheistical assertions. Thus he did with Eve, first, finding
her a little inclinable, he dropped in privily something that might
argue the improbability of the threatened penalty, and then at last
positively denied it. But now if we hold to this, that ‘the command
is true and holy, and just and good,’ he cannot wrest our plea
from us.</p>

<p>[6.] Sixthly, <i>Nothing doth more undermine temptations, by rendering
the reasons and motives thereof vain and empty, than doth the
contrary commands of Scripture</i>. Temptation hath always some
enticement of pleasure or profit, and these only seem to be taking
or reasonable, while we consider not the word of God, as rotten wood
or fish shine only in the dark; but when we are urged with sinful
pleasures, how mean, base, dangerous, and unlovely be they, when the
command to the contrary gives information that they are snares and
lead to death, or the provocation of the Almighty.</p>

<p>[7.] Seventhly, <i>While we resist with Scripture arguments, we engage
God, whose command we would stand by, to go down to the battle with
us</i>. We ‘lay hold upon his strength,’ and put obligations upon him
to take us out of the snare, and to deliver us from him who is ‘too
strong’ for us.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, It remains that, in a word, I shew <i>how the commands
or arguments of Scripture are to be used in resisting Satan</i>, which
is thus, When you have any sinful thought cast into your mind, presently
reject the offer, by charging your heart with duty, from some
opposite command; as if you be urged to acts of uncleanness, presently
refuse, thus; No, I must not, God hath commanded the contrary,
he hath said, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery.’ If a covetous thought
arise, reject it with this, God hath said, ‘Thou shalt not covet.’ If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
you be tempted to please the flesh, and follow vain delights, answer it
with this, ‘If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die;’ and the like must
be done in other temptations.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> Some may perhaps think that this is easy work and quickly
done, and that it seems to attribute a virtue and power to the words of
Scripture, as if Satan were charmed by the language or phrase.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> However at the first view this may seem easy, yet he that
shall consider how much exercise of grace goes necessarily to the right
use of Scripture opposition, shall not see cause to slight it as common,
nor yet to think that any virtue is attributed to the words. For,</p>

<p>[1.] First, The Scripture here is only recommended <i>as a fit instrument,
and no further or higher praise is given</i>. Though therefore we
may attribute the whole of the conquest to the instrument alone, yet
this hinders not, but that as an instrument peculiarly fitted for these
ends, we may commend it above all other instruments, as we may justly
commend bread for nourishing above a stone, and expect more from it
than from a chip; so have we reason to expect more by the use of
Scripture against Satan, than from other means of defence which God
hath not set up for that service.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>It is a concomitancy of divine power and aid that
conquers for us</i>. The instrument is Scripture, but the power by which
it works is from God.</p>

<p>[3.] Thirdly, <i>Neither is it any careless formal use of Scripture
expressions that will give encouragement for expectation of a divine
concurrence</i>; but the use of Scripture in this business implies an
exercise of all graces, for it is an urging of Scripture under a fourfold
consideration.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, As being certainly persuaded of their truth, and fully keeping
to that belief.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, As being thankfully apprehensive of the holiness, goodness,
and profitableness of the commands, and cheerfully adhering to
them as the only way and means to bring us to union with Christ,
and to preserve us in it.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, As being highly and indispensably obliged by them to perform
the duty commanded therein, and to avoid the sins forbidden.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, All this in a humble expectation of a divine help, according
to the promise of God. Now he that can plead the command
or promise against a temptation in this manner, doth not do an
ordinary work, neither will he ascribe the success to the words and
phrase of Scripture.</p>

<p>Some may, peradventure, wonder why Christ, by his example, had
not recommended prayer, seeing it is of such unquestionable use in
our undertakings against Satan. But that inquiry may be fully satisfied,
if it be considered that Christ did peculiarly prepare himself to
this encounter by ‘solemn fasting,’ ver. 2, which doth include praying;
for such complicated duties are often denominated by that part
which is extraordinary, and usually in Scripture a fast is only mentioned
where prayer is chiefly intended. That this fast of Christ
related to the temptation, and that also as a means of preservation,
hath been spoken of in its place; it remains only that from hence
I add a fifth direction.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span></p>




<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXVI_3">CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>The fifth direction, of prayer, and of the seriousness required of those
that expect the advantage of prayer.—Of God’s hearing prayer
while the temptation is continued.—Of some that are troubled more,
while they pray more.</i></p>


<p><i>Direct.</i> 5. <i>That in all our endeavours of resistance, frequent and
earnest prayers are not to be neglected.</i></p>

<p>This is so frequently recommended, and so fully handled by most
authors, that I shall refer you to such authors as particularly treat of
it; noting only that the apostle, in Eph. vi. 18, when he recommends
it to us in these words, ‘Praying always with all prayer and supplication
in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance, and
supplication for all saints,’ he doth mind us that he that expects the
advantage of that duty must be peculiarly fitted, and seriously diligent
in that work. For,</p>

<p>(1.) First, <i>He must have a praying frame of heart</i>; he must
‘pray always,’ or, as the apostle elsewhere, he must ‘pray continually.’
Not as if this duty must swallow up all the rest, and that a Christian
had no other services to attend than prayer, but that he must be on a
design to wrestle with God by prayer; and this must be constantly
carried on, though the acts of prayer be intermitted; and besides that,
in such cases, he may keep his usual stated times for that duty, he
must have his heart so much upon his design, that every occasion or
offer of temptation will presently put him upon the duty; nay, he
must, in respect of the frequent intercourse of his heart with God in
frequent ejaculations and breathings of soul, be as a man wholly
resolved into that duty, as Paul was at his first conversion, who, as
that expression ‘behold he prays’ [Acts ix. 11] doth intimate, seems to
have been all prayer, and wholly taken up with that duty.</p>

<p>(2.) Secondly, <i>He must pray in the spirit</i>, his soul must be truly in
the duty. A more than ordinary earnestness is necessary at solemn
times, he must put out all his strength, he must cry mightily, and
with his whole heart.</p>

<p>(3.) Thirdly, When his spirit grows dull, <i>he must reinforce it</i>,
watch his heart he must; and if it be needful to quicken it up, he
must add fasting or meditation, or whatever other means may be
helpful.</p>

<p>(4.) Fourthly, In this course <i>he must continue without giving off
the duty</i>. Though God behave himself as if he minded not his cry,
or took no notice of his hazard, yet without weariness must our
supplications follow him. It must be continued with ‘all perseverance.’</p>

<p>(5.) Fifthly, <i>The heart that undertakes this must not be so narrow
as to be centred upon his own concern only</i>. When he is melted into
a spirit of meekness and compassion for others, and is not so solicitous
for peace or ease, that he could hug himself in his private enjoyment
without concerning himself to tender and help those that are in the
same dangers, when his supplications are for ‘all saints’ as well as for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
himself, then may he expect to receive an olive branch of peace from
heaven in the return of his prayer.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> It is often objected by such, that they pray but are not heard;
and that temptations continue, notwithstanding many cries and wrestlings.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> [1.] First, <i>It is a great mistake to think that prayers are not
heard or do not prevail, because the temptation is not quite removed</i>.
Prayers may be acceptable to God, and recorded among his remembrances,
where the temptation, for exercise and other holy ends, may
be continued.</p>

<p>[2.] Secondly, <i>What God hath promised to such prayer, he fails not
to make good</i>. He hath not promised to exempt us from temptation,
but from the power and prevalency of it. If ‘his grace be sufficient
for us,’ 2 Cor. xii. 9, in the meantime, it is an answer as good as Paul
got when he was importunate; ‘If together with the temptation he
gives an issue, that we may be able to bear it,’ 1 Cor. x. 13, there is
his faithfulness in keeping promise. He nowhere promised that
Satan should not tempt, but that he should not prevail. While we
can hold up our hands in the mount to God, and our praying frame
will ascertain us of this; ‘for a man is never overcome by a temptation
so long as he can pray against it;’ for so long he delights not in
it so long he consents not, and till he do consent Satan cannot prevail.
Prayer will either make the temptation give way, or the temptation
will make prayer give way; but so long as we hold out with earnestness,
the temptation cannot prevail.</p>

<p><i>Obj.</i> Some further object, that the more they pray they are the
worse, and more infested by Satan than they were before they undertook
that course.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> 1. <i>It may be they may have more trouble from Satan.</i> David
‘thought on God, and his trouble was increased,’ [Ps. xxxix. 3,] and
no wonder. Satan’s spite and fury puts him upon giving greatest
molestations to those of whom he despairs to subdue.</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> 2. Secondly, But though they may be more troubled, <i>yet they
may be furthest from conquest</i>.<a id="FNanchor_492_492" href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> These disquiets are like the trouble
of the working of physic, which at first taking may make a man more
sick, and yet bring him nearer to a state of health and strength; fear
not then, faint not, resist faithfully, and to the utmost, and ‘God shall
bruise Satan under thy feet shortly,’ [Rom. xvi. 20.]</p>

Gilpin contained in the Manuscript. No common service is being rendered by Mr L.
and the Surtees Society, to Ecclesiastical History, in so lovingly and competently preparing
these important memoirs, which shed light on innumerable events and names,
from sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. An abstract of the more interesting passages
was published in 1828 by Sir Charles Sharpe, 8vo, pp. vii. and 35. I have to thank J.

Dr Airay was son of Bernard Gilpin’s sister Helen. See the Apostle’s ‘Will,’ in the
Surtees’ volume of ‘Wills and Inventories, from the Registry at Durham,’ (1860,)
Part II., pp. 83-94. So that the Gilpins and Airays were related. I have to thank
William Jackson, Esq., Fleatham House, St Bees, for calling my attention to this. It
explains obscurities in the life of Airay, and gives a key to Bernard Gilpin’s special
interest in him.</p></div>

In a large quarto manuscript volume of ‘Memoirs’ of the Gilpins, drawn up by the
Prebendary of Salisbury, (<i>supra</i>,) now before me by the kindness of its possessor, Charles
Bernard Gilpin, Esq., Juniper Green, Edinburgh, I find the following concerning the
above points: ‘He was the son of a younger brother, and being born to no estate,
applied the first years of his life to the study of physic. But feeling a stronger inclination
to divinity, he laid aside all thoughts of practising as a physician, and changing entirely
the course of his studies, <i>he took his degrees in divinity</i>; but at what university, I <i>find no
account</i>,’ (page 1.)</p></div>

<i>Ibid.</i> In various authorities the ground of Moreland’s ejection is given as ‘ignorance
and insufficiency’—whatever the latter may mean; but as Walker, who is usually
referred to for it, makes no such statement, I have not adduced it. It is sufficient that
the Commissioners were picked men for intellect and character; and that wherever <i>data</i>
remain, their decisions are almost invariably warranted by the premises.</p></div>

‘A Sermon preached at the Funeral of Mr John Noble of Penruddock, near Penrith,
in Cumberland, March 14, 1707-8. By Samuel Audland. To which is added a Postscript
concerning the Deceased, by another hand.’ London (reprinted) 1818, pp. 37, 38.
The little ‘Chapel’ wherein this Sermon was preached still remains, and has now as its
minister the Rev. David Y. Storrar, who occupies it as a mission-charge of the United
Presbyterian Church (of Scotland). This congregation originated, it is believed, from
those who could not remain in the Parish Church of Greystoke after Gilpin left and
Moreland returned; and thus is of the oldest of the Presbyterian congregations in England.
See above tractate, whence we learn that on Dr Gilpin’s ‘motion,’ the Nonconformists
of Greystoke ‘called’ another to fill his place for them. Then the Narrative
continues: ‘Mr Anthony Sleigh, a native of the same parish, and bred in the College of
Durham, was obtained to become their minister, and so continued about forty years,
though he had only slender [pecuniary] encouragements there. Their meeting was held
mostly in the house of John Noble, and sometimes under covert of the night, as Christ’s
disciples sometimes did,’ (page 44.)</p></div>

The ‘Noble’ Postscript says, ‘Somewhat remarkable happened at his resuming the
pulpit, which some living (1708) can tell, but I omit it.’ Moreover, Morland’s return
was against the wishes of the parishioners: for the narrative continues, ‘After this
some offered to put up one Mr Jackson in the pulpit: which the contrary party did
so violently oppose with threats to crush them into the earth, that Mr Jackson went with
them to the parsonage-house, and preached there,’ (p. 43.) M. died in about a year.</p></div>

‘A good old aunt of mine—mother of the present Mr Fawcett of Scaleby Castle—took
particular pride in shewing a certain very large room in her Castle. Her theory
was that this was one of the great attractions of the place in Dr Gilpin’s view: for here
he would have room enough to preach to as many people as were likely to attend, and
liberty also: Scaleby, as she observed, being at just such a distance from Carlisle as
to place him beyond the operation of the Conventicle Act.’—<i>Charles Bernard Gilpin,
Esq., Juniper Green, Edinburgh.</i></p></div>

That is James Fawcett, Esq. I do not know how sufficiently to acknowledge the
courtesy and kindness of Mr and Mrs Fawcett in furthering my Gilpin inquiries.
Besides early drawings and recent photographs of the Castle and grounds, I have had an
ancient unpublished family-volume of rare interest confided to me. It is entitled ‘An
Accompt of the most Considerable Estates and Families in the County of Cumberland,
from the Conquest unto the beginning of the Reign of K. James the First.’ The
original MS., an inscription informs us, is supposed to have been ‘writ by an ancestor of
Mr Denton’s of Cardow during ye time of his imprisont. (as ‘tis said) in ye Tower upon
a Contest yt happ’ned to be betwixt him and Dr Robinson, then Bp. of Carliell.’ This
‘copy’ seems to have been taken about 1687. I cull the following <i>memoranda</i> concerning
Scaleby from this precious little volume: ‘Ye Castle ... took name first of ye
buyldings there wch they call Scheales or Scales, more properly of ye Latin word
Scalinga, a caban or cottage. When King Henry 1st had established Carliell [Carlisle]
he gave yt lordship unto one Richard the Ryder, whose surname was Tylliolf, who first
planted there habitations. From him it descended by one or two degrees unto Symon
Tylliolf in ye later end of King Henry 2d’s tyme. His son, Piers Tylliolf or Peter,
was ward to Geoffrey de Lucy by the king’s grant about ye tyme of K. John. This
Geoffrey de Lucy did bear ye cap of maintenance before K. Richard 1st at his coronation.
Sr. Peter de Tilliol, kt., son of Sr. Robt., dyed, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1434: 13 Henr. 6, having enjoyed
his estate 67 years. He had issue one son who dyed without issue in 1435, when the
estates were divided between two sisters and co-heirs, Isabella and Margaret. Isabella had
married one John Colville, and his son Wm. succeeded and died 1479, leaving two daughters,
Phillis and Margaret. The eldest was married to Wm. Musgrave. Margaret, the 2d
daughter, married to Nicholas Musgrave, and transferred Scaleby, Haydon, and other
Lands to his posterity. Sr. Edwd. Musgrave, Kt., son of Wm., married Katherine Penruddock:
he built or repaired part of ye Castle at Scaleby <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1606.... Sir Wm.
Edwd. Musgrave, Bart., of Nova Scotia, who afterwards suffering great losses on ye
account of his faithful service to K. Charles I and K. Charles ye 2d, he was forced to
dismember a great part of his estate. He sold Kirklevington to Edmund Appelby,
Houghton to Arthur Forster, Richardby to Cuthbert Studholm, and <i>Scaleby</i> to Richard
Gilpin, who now [1687] enjoys ye same together wth Richardby, wch he also purchased
of Michael Studholm, <i>fil</i> Cuthberti,’ [p. 432.] [On Scaleby, cf. pp. 429-435.] There are
similar interesting notices of Greystoke, or Graystock, or Graistock, which is explained
to mean ‘a badger,’ [cf. pp. 311-315,] going back with old lore to Syolf, and Phorne,
and Ranulph in the days of the 1st Henry, on to the Dacres, and Norfolks, and Arundel.
Scaleby Castle has been much enlarged, together with the Estates, and the visitor of the
district will find it a delightful pilgrimage. The older trees are all the more venerable
that one knows Dr Gilpin himself ‘planted’ them.
</p>
<p>
To shew the way Royalists suffered themselves to speak of even so ‘moderate’ and so
inestimable a man as our Worthy, simply because he continued conscientiously a Nonconformist
at enormous sacrifices, I add here a quotation from the ‘County’ History:
N. and B.’s Westmoreland and Cumberland, as before, vol. ii. p. 459: ‘Scaleby: Mr
Sandford—in the true spirit of those times—speaking of Scaleby, says, “It was sometime
the estate of Sir Edward Musgrave of Hayton, baronet; but now sold to Mr
Gilpin, a quondam preacher of the fanatical parliament, and his wife, Mr Brisco’s
daughter, of Crofton, brethren of confusion in their brains; knew what they would not
have, but knew not what they would have, if they might chuse.”’ This ‘reviling’ is
High Church charity; and it is wondered at that Nonconformists retort sharply when
occasion offers.</p></div>

‘Life’ of <span class="smcap">Bernard Gilpin</span>, as before, p. 128, <i>seq.</i> The coincidence is certainly
striking of the double offer, at the distance of fully a century, of a bishopric, and the same
bishopric, to two Gilpins, and a double declinature and actualisation of the ‘<i>nolo episcopari</i>.’
This and even more remarkable, because more intricate and manifold, repetitions,
in the Lives of the elder and younger Edwards of America, [Cf. Memoir of the
latter, prefixed to his Works, Vol. i. pp. xxxiii, xxxiv. Andover, U.S. 1842.] have
been turned to excellent account in refuting the so-called objections of scepticism and
rationalism to the repetition of the incidents and miracles and sayings of the Lord in the
Gospels.</p></div>

Further on, and in his epitaph, we shall find allusions to the declined bishopric, as
having greatly added to the influence of Dr Gilpin, as the acceptance of one by Reynolds
neutralised even his worth, and stains his memory indelibly.</p></div>

Raine’s ‘Depositions’ as before: foot-note by Mr Longstaffe, pp. 172, 173. Theologically,
<i>William Durant</i> was unquestionably evangelically orthodox, and in no sense,
save that the Church-property is held by the Unitarians, can he be called the ‘founder’
of their Church in Newcastle. By the same plea Matthew Henry of Chester, and
scores of others, might be claimed as ‘Founders’ of Unitarian congregations. I state
this simply as matter-of-fact, and not controversially. I may observe that Gilpin’s
‘Letter’ to Stratton (onwards) more probably indicates the commencement of the
Unitarian ‘separation.’</p></div>

Turner, in giving the above extract, misled by 1699, imagines it must refer to some
other Dr Gilpin. He forgot that the year did not begin then until March 25; so that,
while under our reckoning it was 1700, under the old it was 1699; and hence the marking
until the change of the going and coming year, <i>e.g.</i>, 1699-1700.</p></div>

moral and religious condition of our country at the period. There are innumerable
sketches of persons and places of mark all over North and South, given with a transparent
<i>naiveté</i> and occasional raciness of wording that is very taking. Story continued
to be received on the most friendly terms by the Gilpins, and by sons and daughters
after Dr Gilpin himself was dead. Cf. pp. 470-473.</p></div>

It may be well to give in a foot-note Story’s account of another and later visit to
Dr Gilpin:—‘The same evening I visited Dr Richard Gilpin, formerly mentioned,
having still a great respect for him and all his family. He was an eminent physician
and preacher among the Presbyterians at Newcastle; to which place he had removed
from Cumberland after the Revolution. And with him also I had some discourse about
matters of religion; in which he discovered more passion and prejudice than became
his high profession or years, and could not bear any contradiction. But I advised him
to beware of that spirit, for it wanted mortification: and this I did in a calm and
respectful mind, which reached the better part in him, and brought it over the evil;
and then I left him in a loving temper. For though he was naturally high, and the
most eminent and celebrated preacher of that profession in the North, and from his
very early days deeply prejudiced, and almost envious, against Friends, yet he heard me
with more patience—though that was little—than he ever did any other.’—P. 100.</p></div>
